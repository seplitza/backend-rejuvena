Jumping can be replaced by running in place.<br>The best time for this exercise is in the morning when you just woke up and still did not even have a glass of water or so.</p><p>What does this jump-the-lymph-exercise give us?<br>- Lymphatic system receives support in cleansing from cell waste;<br>- The body is mobilized, the metabolism is accelerated;<br>- It is the number-one-treatment for skin laxity;<br>- Cellulite is reduced;<br>- Excess fluid is slowly removed, which results in reduction of edemas and all the edematous congestion.</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> The course is designed for conventionally healthy people. If you have any chronic medical conditions or have recently had a surgery, please do not jump.<br>Pregnant women should also not jump.</p><p>Ladies, hold your breast while jumping.<br>If you are overweight, you should start with easy jumping, which means a low jumping height and a lower number of jumps. You can increase the height and the number, when you feel like it.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- Find a free space with a solid floor.<br>- Go on your tiptoes and let your body weight fall naturally on your heels. Continue these jumps, gradually increasing the jumping height and the speed.<br>- Do about 30 to 40 jumps the first time. You can gradually increase the number of jumps up to 100 on the following days of practice.</p><p><strong>Important!</strong><br>Do not lift your toes off the floor, it is not necessary to bounce, but to hit the floor with your heels. The floor still can shake. Be sure to choose a solid floor. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have swelling in your entire body, you can repeat this jumping exercise in the afternoon and in the evening, but not later than 1 hour before going to bed.

Perform the exercise either on moist skin or ideally after applying a day cream or tonic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- You will need your both hands for this technique. Place the inner edge of your palms on the sides of your nose. The knuckles of your index fingers should be placed at the corners of your lips. The thumbs should meet under the chin area. Press the muscle under your chin with your thumbs before you start the motion.<br>- Slightly slide over your face with the inner edges of the palms towards the ears.<br>- When you reach your ears with the index fingers, run the fingers from the ears down the neck to the collarbones. After you reach the collarbones, on the exhalation, press in your fingers under the collarbone for 1 to 2 seconds.<br>- Repeat the exercise 2 to 3 times. You can perform the exercise up to 5 times, if you feel like it.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>You are probably asking yourself: Will I not stretch my skin too much?... <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f631.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>Don&rsquo;t worry, your skin will not stretch too much!<br>Do not forget about moisturizing and smoothing your face, and you will never have to ask yourself this question during the practice again.</p><p>If you have a full face, and you feel like it, repeat the exercise in the evening.<br>Observe the reaction of your face, and listen to your sensations.</p><p>Check out the 2nd video to see what your lymphatic system of the head and neck look like. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f44c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Good luck!&nbsp;</em><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

                        "exerciseDescription": "<p><strong>Head rotations</strong></p><p>This is an amazing exercise which is going to help you return mobility to your neck! It is a basic exercise that you need to have always at your disposal.&nbsp;</p><p>This exercise:</p><p>- improves your neck zone (cervical spine) functional mobility;</p><p>- warms up your neck muscles;</p><p>- dissolves possible congestion in the cervical zone;</p><p>- restores the physiological tone of the neck muscles back to normal;</p><p>- corrects the neck static;</p><p>- prevents osteochondrosis and arthritis in the neck area.</p><p><strong>Caution:&nbsp;</strong>You can practice it any time of the day in any convenient situation. Do it before you start with other neck exercises and also after it. But start by doing it very very gently.</p><p>If you are doing it for the first time in your life, you may be surprised by cracking sounds and possible sudden aches.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The technique:</strong></p><ul><li>Don&rsquo;t forget to control your breathing while doing any exercise. Deep inhale and then long exhale without pauses.</li><li>Stand up straight, let your arms hang down relaxed, and reach upwards with the top of your head and relax.&nbsp;</li><li>Let&rsquo;s call it the crown of your head. It is also a nice to imagine that you have something very important on your head <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f607.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> .</li><li>Then slowly drop your head as if you would try to touch your chest with the chin while exhaling.&nbsp;</li><li>Start to move your crown to the left and upwards doing semicircle while inhaling until your head gets to the position when the back of it looks down and you look up.</li><li>Continue the rotation from this position while exhaling by pointing your crown to the right then drop your chin down again. Imagine the crown drawing circles over your head.&nbsp;</li><li>Continue rotations to the right and do it 4 more times. Do not speed up! Keep doing it gently even if you feel alright after the first circle.</li><li>Do the same rotations to the left side. 5 times.&nbsp;</li><li>Keep doing it slowly and gently.</li><li>The larger circles you can draw with your crown, the more flexible and prepared for further exercises your neck is.</li></ul><p><strong>Attention!&nbsp;</strong>The technique is simple but please pay much attention to what you feel while doing the exercise. Any sharp pain can be a signal to cervical spine osteochondrosis. In that case you have to be very careful and attentive to your neck area. Any other exercise for your neck should be done very gently.&nbsp;</p><p>Do not ask me to diagnose what can be wrong with your neck, I am not a doctor. Besides, in that case, you need to see a doctor in person to get the correct diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Tale:&nbsp;</strong>PLEASE DO NOT THINK THIS IT IS NOT YOUR CASE!&nbsp;</p><p>I made this mistake when I did this neck exercise for the first time at the age of 40, 8 years after my last yoga class. I thought I was still flexible enough and stretching my neck would be an easy task.</p><p>It WAS! &nbsp;Very easy... <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f62d.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; BUT I ended up with a lumbago in my neck area which kept me from doing any other neck exercises for the next half a year. I had to downgrade it and go through a rehabilitation course to return mobility, strength and healthy feeling in the neck. This course is now called &quot;Take it easy&quot;, it consists of 20 easy exercises aimed at returning the mobility to your spine, and you can find this amazing course in the app.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Extra:&nbsp;</strong>Head rotations can be done in a sitting position, too. The standing position is more<em>&nbsp;</em>preferred just because all the following neck exercises are done from a standing position.</p><p><em>Good luck!</em> <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Have you tried?</strong></p><p>I bet you have heard many interesting sounds by now! :)) &nbsp;Clicks, crunching and even cracks are kind of normal... They are even normally expected.</p><p>I have been doing this exercise every day for past 4 years. My neck still does some clicking and crunching from time to time, but a lot less than before and I am no longer having any concerns about getting a lumbago.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Got sudden pain? Do not hesitate to consult your doctor!</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Just the weight of your arms is enough to do the trick.</p><p>- Tilt your head down, feel the tension in the back of the neck, relax your arms.</p><p>- Stay in this position for the next 4 inhale-exhale rounds.&nbsp;</p><p>- Control your breathing. Breathe evenly in and out, do not hold the breath.</p><p><strong>3 Action</strong>. Compensation</p><p>- After the last exhaling, while inhaling you slowly start moving your head upwards with your locked hands compensating for this movement with slight resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>- Fix your head in a perfectly upright position. The head is slightly pushing against your locked hands.</p><p>- Stay in this position for 2 inhale-exhale rounds. Breathe deep and evenly.</p><p><strong>Repeat</strong> the actions 2 and 3 for 2 inhale-exhale rounds each.</p><p>- Close your eyes for a few seconds and feel your neck and its new position.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Attention!</strong></p><p>No pressure on the head, while it is tilted toward the chest. Just the weight of your arms should perform the natural pressure. If you think, your hands might be too heavy, you should be especially careful and try to compensate for the natural pressure in order to make it lighter.</p><p>This exercise is good on its own, but you should never skip it out when doing the neck complex.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Take it easy!&nbsp;</em><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

                        "exerciseDescription": "<p><strong>Complex of neck exercises. 3. Sides</strong></p><p>Basics, basics for every day!<br>Exercise on the sides of your neck.</p><p>- Your neck gets long and strong;</p><p>- The side muscles of your neck are relaxed and better supplied with blood;</p><p>- Tension in your shoulders is reduced;</p><p>- Your head&rsquo;s supply with blood also improves, which results in a relief of headaches and shoulder pain.</p><p><strong>Caution:&nbsp;</strong>If you do it correctly, you will feel comfortable at any time while exercising.<br>Slow and gentle movements are the key to a healthy neck in this exercise.<br>The word &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; here means a slight pressure against the main movement.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong></p><p><strong>1 Action</strong>. Hump</p><p>- Stand in the upright position, stretch your crown upwards, relax your shoulders and arms.</p><p>- Put your right hand on your waist so that your arm and a bodyside would make a triangle. Now stretch the long side of this triangle by lifting the right shoulder as high as possible. Your trapezoid muscle should make a hump.</p><p>- Use this hump as base for your neck and your head, tilt your head slowly toward the uplifted shoulder. Your neck must firmly meet with the hump that you created with your trapezoid muscle, the ear may not necessarily touch the shoulder - it is not what we are aiming for. The goal is to get a slight pressure of the contracted trapezoids on the right side of your neck.</p><p>- Control your breathing. Breathe smoothly. Try to make your breathing in and out equally long.&nbsp;</p><p>- Keep this position for 4 deep inhale-exhale rounds; Return your head to the upright position and let your strained arm relax, spot the difference in sensations to the opposite side.</p><p><strong>2 Action</strong>. Stretching</p><p>- Keep your head in the upright position. Put your left hand over the head as if you were trying to grab your right ear. Let your left palm rest on the right side of your head.</p><p>- Tilt your head slowly to the left &ndash; the opposite side of where you made a hump previously. The hump and the neck are getting stretched now.</p><p>- The hand rests on your head without any tension, keep it relaxed. The hand performs slight pressure using its own weight only. Do not push!</p><p>- Relax the shoulder of the arm that rests on your head.</p><p>- Control your breathing. Breathe smoothly. Try to inhale and exhale equally long.&nbsp;</p><p>- Keep this position for the next 4 deep inhale-exhale rounds.</p><p><strong>3. Action</strong>. Compensation</p><p>- Return the head slowly in the upright position. The hand now is compensating the return action of the head, keeping the neck in the stretched state. Let the palm be in the same place until the very end of the action.</p><p>When your head is straight up with your hand compensating it with a slight pressure, keep this compensating pressure for the next 2 rounds of breathing in and out. Both the head and the hand &laquo;want&raquo; to keep the head in the perfectly upright position.</p><p>Start slowly with the stretching action again. Stay in the stretched position for 2 inhale and exhale rounds. Return your head to the upright position with the compensating pressure by your hand.</p><p>Now let your hand down. Relax. Close your eyes for 5 seconds and spot the difference between the left and the right side.</p><p>Repeat the sequence for the other side of your body.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong></p><p>As with all neck exercises, perform it very slowly&nbsp;and be attentive to your sensations. If you do it right and keep your neck as long as possible in every position, you are not going to experience any discomfort.</p><p>! DO NOT try to reach shoulders with your ears. This can cause serious troubles to your neck; it is not the action we need.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Tale:</p><p>Well, I do this exercise every day. At least once in the morning as a part of the neck complex. I also do it any other time of the day when I feel discomfort in the neck-shoulder area. It is a great relaxation technique!</p><p><br></p><p>Have you tried?</p><p>What were your sensations in the left and right side before you did the opposite side?</p><p><br></p><p><em>Take care of your neck!&nbsp;</em><br><em>It is the pedestal for your pretty face</em> <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f64f.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Trapezius</strong><br>Stretching the trapezius muscles.</p><p>- Your head posture improves;</p><p>- The neck gets longer and stronger;</p><p>- Tension in shoulders is released;</p><p>- Your head&rsquo;s supply with blood also improves;</p><p>- The better feeling in the body as a whole. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> Please perform this exercise slowly and gently. Remember, be especially careful if you never trained your neck muscles, we don&rsquo;t want to risk a lumbago. If you do the technique correctly, the neck will only get stronger and longer.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong></p><p><strong>1. Action</strong>. Rest on the hump</p><p>- Stand up in the upright position with a hand on your waist, your thumb looking down and your middle finger pointing to the spine bone. Your palm is resting on the part of your body where you suppose your kidney. Move your elbow backwards. Your arm and the bodyside would make a triangle. Now stretch the long side of this triangle by lifting your shoulder as high as possible. Your trapezius muscles should make a hump. This hump will be the base for the back of your head. Now turn your head in the opposite direction to the hump and look upwards. The back of your head should comfortably rest on the hump. No extra tension here.<br>- Stay in this position for 4 inhale-exhale rounds. Breathe evenly.</p><p><strong>2. Action</strong>. Stretching</p><p>- Return your head to the upright position and let your strained arm relax.<br>- With the other hand, take the back of your head, so that your wrist lies on the top of the head and fingers are pointing down. Ideally, the elbow would look outstretched. The hand here controls the following stretching.<br>- Tilt your head towards the chest, then move it slowly to the armpit of your controlling arm. Stretch your chin towards the armpit. Stay in this position for 4 inhale-exhale rounds. Breathe evenly, feel the muscles being stretched, starting from your skull and ending in your shoulder.</p><p><strong>3. Action</strong>. Compensation</p><p>- Return your head to the upright position by going the same way back. The controlling hand compensates the movement, which has the effect of slowing down the return movement with its natural weight.<br>- Stay in the upright position for the next 2 inhale-exhale rounds. The controlling hand is fixing the head and doesn&rsquo;t let it go backwards. Yet the all-up tension would be pointed up.</p><p>Repeat the stretching and fixing sequence and hold it for 2 inhale-exhale rounds each.&nbsp;</p><p>Repeat the sequence for the other side of your body.</p><p>It is the last exercise of the neck complex. It is advisable to do the <strong>head rotations after</strong> it.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong></p><p>The controlling hand is for control only. Do not push while stretching. Its own weight is just enough pressure. If you think your hand might be too heavy, do not let all of its weight lay on your head. Listen to your body and try to find the right pressure.</p><p>Do the neck complex of exercises every day, and soon you will be amazed at how much longer your neck would become.<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f642.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>Take care! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Let all your muscles release the tension, only some muscles in the back are compensating this relaxation and keep your spine straight against the wall.</p><p>- While relaxing, keep your calves, back shoulder blades and the back of the head well attached to the wall. Correct the position, if they are not.</p><p>- Flatten your body gradually against the wall while keeping it relaxed. Your arms should be hanging relaxed.</p><p>If you are the one to go for 10 minutes every day - you are probably the king of posture! After a month of practice, you should check your height, don&rsquo;t be surprised, if you get half an inch taller.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>If you are overweight then getting your heels, calves and buttocks to touch the same surface would be difficult. In this case, step away from the wall just a bit, but surely keep your buttocks, back shoulder blades, and the back of the head to the surface.<br>You can get some strange sensations across your body, which are normally expected for beginners. It could be trembling, itching, a slight numbing in your legs and arms. It will gradually subside every day. One day you will find yourself resting in this pose, I promise.&nbsp;<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like a new person every time after this exercise.

Our body structures grow together, forming connective tissues in the wrong place or in excess of its healthy amount.</p><p>This process is also called <strong>tissue fibrosis</strong>.</p><p>Exactly the same process can occur with the GA. Our goal is to restore the mobility to the GA so that the tissues can return to their right place. When the GA is not flexible enough, the skin formed to folds and wrinkles on the neck and face wouldn&rsquo;t return to its original position... So, please take this exercise very seriously!</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- At first, we make an easy test. Press any place on your scalp with your index finger (frontal part where your hair starts to grow, crown, nape, or the most stubborn place behind the ears) and try to move the skin crosswise (right, left, forward, backward).<br>Does it move in all directions? How much does it shift? Does it shift at all the places?<br>Ideally, the shift should be about half an inch in each direction. The GA massage will bring you to these great results.</p><p>- The technique is simple and variable; you can take this massage creatively. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; Our goal is to return mobility.<br>- You can use all your fingers, 8 or 10 as you wish. Place them on your scalp at any convenient place to start with and press the skin with your fingers to the skull. Start with crosswise movements&nbsp;(right, left, forward, backward). 2 to 3 will be enough, then you can move further to the nearby area about 1 inch further.<br>- Perform this technique all over the skull, all the hairy part of your head (including the parts where the hair growth has decreased).<br>- If you come across the parts that are completely resistant to a crosswise shift, you can try other massage movements: circular, shift to one side, pushing. There is room for creativity. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f44d.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>- Harming yourself with this technique is virtually impossible, but the benefits from this exercise would grow in progression to your efforts.<br>- Ideally, the skin on the scalp should move along with the fingers. If your fingers slide a little through the hair, nothing wrong with it, it&rsquo;s even useful for stimulating the hair growth. With GA massage, the blood supply to the hair follicles is significantly improved, the hair becomes stronger and grows faster.</p><p><strong>Common question:</strong><br>Can this massage make my hair fall out? I treat them with care ... <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f636.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>Answer: The weak hair that you would lose anyway soon, may fall out. But it is a good thing, because new, healthier hair will grow there, if you keep doing the GA massage every day. The hair follicles are provided with a better nutrition, so that your hair would recover and grow fast. We have been seeing many happy followers whose hair growth has been restored. Take a look at our model, he is 45 years old, he has been practicing the GA massage (in different variations) since the age of 18, his hair is still thick as in his young years.</p><p>Practice well and enjoy!<br><em>Good luck!&nbsp;</em><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

The muscle is contracted when you are concentrating for a long time, or when you are making a serious face. It helps you to look more serious but leaves unwanted lines right in the middle of your face. Now it&rsquo;s time to relax it and smooth the marks the life left on your face.<br>- It is a great and also easy technique to bring the procerus muscle back in its original shape.<br>- Nose bridge lines are getting smoothed.<br>- Frown lines are smoothed too.<br>- Habit to frown is reduced.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br><strong>1st step</strong>. Press into the muscles<br>- Use your both index fingers for this technique. Place your fingertips side by side on the bridge of the nose and press them into the muscle to the bone. Press hard, in this exercise you are allowed do so. Feel the pressure and hold it for 10 seconds.<br>- Slowly pull the fingertips apart until the eyebrows.<br>- Repeat the motion 3 to 5 times.<br><strong>2nd step</strong>. Roll out<br>- Place your index fingers horizontally one over another. The hand of the upper finger would point up, and the one of the lower finger would point down. Place the fingers on the nose bridge with some pressure.<br>- Roll the fingers so that the hands would change the position from pointing up to pointing down and vice versa.<br>- After the rolling movement is finished, stretch this area by pulling the fingers apart a little.<br>- You can repeat the 2nd step 2 to 3 times.</p><p>All in all, it wouldn&rsquo;t take more than one minute.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>For this exercise you won&rsquo;t&nbsp;need any oils. You need a good grip on your skin.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Good luck! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p>*The frontal muscle (&lsquo;musculus frontalis&rsquo; in Latin) is a muscle which covers parts of the forehead.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

No oil required for this technique. Remember the Baby-Power Rule while working with face and especially near your eyes. Eyelids are very sensitive tissues; they may be harmed easily when treated incautiously.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br><strong>1&nbsp;</strong>Action. <strong>Warm-up</strong><br>- Make a fold out of the soft tissues of your eyebrow and the ones surrounding it, including the puckering eyebrow muscle using both hands. Start with massaging pinching-like movements with light friction, moving along the superciliary arch* from your nose bridge to the middle of the eyebrow.<br><strong>2&nbsp;</strong>Action. <strong>Stretching</strong><br>- Make the same fold starting from the nose bridge. Start stretching the eyebrow muscle. The one hand is the fixing one, the other one is the pulling one. Pull the soft tissues along the fold towards the end of the eyebrow. The fold is thought to be about half inch long (1,5 cm). Place the fixing hand further to the end of your eyebrow and make another fold. You may need to do up to 3 folds one after another before you reach the middle of the eyebrow. Perform the pulling technique on every fold.</p><p>Repeat the sequence on the other side.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>Do not overdo it, please.

In this exercise, you learn how to work with your fingers deep and slow. When we say &quot;slow,&quot; it really means slow, about one millimetre in 5 seconds.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- Place your elbows on a table. Let the weight of your head lean the hooks. The back of your neck should be relaxed.<br>- Form your index fingers to &ldquo;hooks&rdquo;. Place both fingers on the nose bridge and push deep down to the bone. Feel the tissues for 10 to 20 seconds.<br>- One &ldquo;hook&rdquo; is the fixing one, you don&#39;t move it. The other one is the working one, you do move it, but very slowly, from the middle of your forehead towards the middle of your eyebrow.<br>- Return the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; to the start position. Repeat the action for the other side.<br>- Place the &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; a bit higher than your nose bridge. Now you can put them side by side with the finger joints touching each other. Push them in to the bone and keep them like this for 10 to 20 seconds. Compare your sensations to the previous position.<br>- Repeat the same slow movements using your working &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; for about 1 inch (2.5 centimetres)<br>- Place your &ldquo;finger hooks&rdquo; further up again. You may need to do it several times before you reach the hairline. Repeat the action.<br>- Going over the hairline is OK, it is even appreciated.<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f44d.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Attention!&nbsp;</strong><br>The movements of the working finger should be deep and slow, but not too long. The fixing finger should not drop the pressure while the working finger is moving.</p><p>How did it go?

Today you learn the first basic technique, so please pay special attention to these muscles.</p><p>At first, a little bit of the anatomy.<br><span class=\"fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable fr-active\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"true\"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/542173520\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"fr-draggable\"></iframe></span><br>These muscles have long scientific names:<br>1. The muscle that lifts the upper lip and nose wing is called Musculus levator labii superioris alaequae nasi in Latin. It runs along the nose. Contracted it lifts the upper lip and the tip of the nose. The muscle is attached to the upper frontal process of the maxilla (visibly under the lacrimal canals of the eyes) &nbsp;and inserts into the skin of the lateral part of the nostril and upper lip.(F1)<br>2. The muscle that lifts the upper lip (lat. Musculus levator labii superioris) starts at the infraorbital margin (the lower margin of the eye socket) above the infraorbital foramen (a small opening in the bone below) and inserts into the skin of the lateral part of the nostril and upper lip. (F2)<br>These both muscles are very important for facial expressions. They contract visibly when we smell something stinky and say &quot;Phi ..&quot;. Therefore, as it is somewhat cumbersome to use their full names and for the sake of simplicity, we will call the one that is closer to the nose - F1, and the one that is farther from the nose - F2.<br>The F1 and F2 are the upper lip lifting muscles.<br>By contracting, they lift the lip and also form the nasolabial fold and the bumps above it. In a contracted state, the nasolabial fold is always present on the face ... and becomes more distinguished, if you do not relax these F lifters muscles properly.</p><p>So, let&#39;s start relaxing the F lifters muscles. At the same time, you get an excellent lymphatic drainage of the nasal area, which has lots of benefits:<br>- The nasolabial folds start to shrink.<br>- The asymmetry of the nose and the lacrimal grooves is leveled off.<br>- The bruises, dark circles and puffiness under the eyes starts to diminish.<br>- The F muscles are relaxed and prepared for the more advanced techniques.</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> Remember the rule of a one-year-old child&rsquo;s strength. Do not hurt yourself. You should feel comfortable during the whole exercise. You can adjust the strength for this exercise yourself later.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- You need both index and middle fingers for this exercise. Place them on the nasolabial fold so that the middle fingers are in the corners of the nose wings. The index and middle fingers are pressed together.<br>- Press in the soft tissues slightly, hold it like this for 3 to 5 seconds, and then begin small-amplitude circular massage movements. Circular motions in this case are similar to digging: inward, to the nose, then upwards with pressure, then outwards releasing the pressure and finally down.<br>- After a few circular movements, the index finger will reach the orbital bone. As soon as you feel this, raise your index finger, you no longer need it for the massage. Continue massaging with your middle fingers only until they reach the lacrimal canAls of the eyes.<br>- Slide your middle fingers to the nose wings starting from the lacrimal canals. The fingers go straight down the The muscle that lifts the upper lip and nose wing (F1). Feel them stretching and relaxing.<br>- Repeat it one more time. 2 sets shouldn&rsquo;t take longer than a minute.<br>- When you are done with the exercise, smooth out the skin surface pressing it with your fingers and moving upwards from below. Try to &ldquo;place&rdquo; the skin the way you would like to have it. It shouldn&rsquo;t take more than 5 to10 seconds.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>The exercise is easy and comforting but don&rsquo;t get carried away too much the first time. Remember, in this business, regularity is more important than intensity. And the increased intensity in the early stages can lead to discomfort the next day, which may make you want to stop or take a break. And breaks during the study course are not really useful.</p><p><em>Good luck! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Then this is the right exercise for you!<br>But it is more than just for beautiful and full lips. This exercise tones the circular muscle of the mouth, which has a positive effect on the general appearance of the mouth.</p><p>Please remember that the rejuvenation is a complex process. So, leaving out a part of the face unattended can upset the dynamics of the process as a whole, even if you don&rsquo;t see the effect right away.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> You work on the muscle (orbicularis muscle of the mouth), not on the lips, although you should also pay attention to the lips, especially at their relaxed state.</p><p>Check out what muscles you will work on</p><p><span class=\"fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"true\"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/543684139\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"fr-draggable\"></iframe></span><br></p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- Clamp the corners of your lips, in their usual position, with the outer edge or the base of your palms. Press them to the teeth. They should not slip out of this grip.<br>- Purse your lips forward and form them in a bell shape. At the same time, the border of your lips should be relaxed. Hold it for up to 1 minute.<br>- If you are aiming for beautiful lips, you can repeat the exercise up to 5 times a day.</p><p>Attention!<br>When you purse out your lips, you should constantly remember that the border of the lips must be relaxed. It is not always that easy to learn this right away.

These hooks are going to do the main work. The thumbs are your fixing fingers.<br>- Place your thumbs under the chin and fix them firmly, at the first position the thumbs are touching each other.<br>- Place your hooked index fingers on the chin and press in for 20 seconds.<br>- Start with circling massage movements using your hooked finger. Keep the circles small. 5-10 circles are enough for the first time. Listen to your sensations.<br>- Move the fixing thumb to the next position towards your ear, so that &ldquo;the hook&rdquo; move on to the new area without leaving out any area of your jawline untouched. Move along the whole jawline and keep doing the same circling massage movements.<br>- When you reach the end of your jawline, you can use both index and middle fingers for more intensive massage of the big and strong chewing muscle.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>Perform the exercise on clean skin only, please. You won&rsquo;t need any oils for this and the next couple of similar exercises. You&rsquo;ll naturally force out some sebum (the secret of sweat and sebaceous glands) that would let your fingers move around smoothly without stretching the face skin. Don&rsquo;t worry about it.

Fix the one &ldquo;hook&rdquo; firmly to your jawline, the other one grabs the jawline firmly and starts moving towards the ear. The thumb under the chin is leading the action. It follows the jawline till the very end of it. It should pass the jaw angle and finish the action by touching the ear.<br>- When you spot a bump or any other unevenness, make a break from the exercise for a moment and give it a bit of a massage with your fingertips, then continue the smoothing action.<br>- 5 to 10 times are enough. Listen to your sensations, please. They normally give you the feeling of how many times are enough for you.</p><p>- Repeat the sequence on the other side.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>The smoothing action should be performed with a <strong>strong grab</strong> of your jawline, <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f4aa.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60e.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; quite seldom I use this word.

Normally we do not waste any thoughts on it. We just accept the fact that the face is swelling as years pass. In fact, the main reason for this is a clogged lymphatic system which makes our skin look thicker. We normally put up with it until it gets too heavy and starts pulling parts of a face down, bringing such unpleasant effects like loose skin, puffy lower eyelid and nasolabial folds.<br>Most of the lymph fluid from the face region goes through the lymph nodes in the neck area. If&nbsp;the lymph transport system doesn&rsquo;t work properly, it results in a clogged lymphatic system in the neck area. The more lymph is stagnating there, the more symptoms like uneven jawline, double chin, neck lines, fibrosis and lymphedema.<br>We are not going to dwell on the reasons for lymphedema, they are very complex and there are too many of them. Our goal is to make the lymph transport system work better in order to get rid of the unhealthy volume.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br><strong>1. Action</strong>. Warm-up with large pinches<br>All in all about 1 minute.<br>- You need both hands for this exercise. Use your thumbs and the index fingers formed to hooks. Pinch the area below the jaw. Try to grab as much soft tissues as possible when you do the pinches.<br>- Work your way through the area of your neck from the chin to Adam&#39;s apple. You can even go further down under the Adam&#39;s apple, if you feel like doing it.<br><strong>2. Action</strong>. Squeeze out excess of fluids<br>All in all about 1 minute for the both sides.<br>- Use the same thumbs and &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; but this time you work single-handed. On the right side you work with your right hand, on the left side with your left hand.<br>- Start working from the middle of the area under your chin. Take the thumb from the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; apart as much as possible. Place the thumb under the jaw angle, the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; should be under the chin. The thumb is for fixing and the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; is our working finger here. Squeeze out the soft tissues towards the thumb letting the flesh slip out from the pinch.<br>- As soon as the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; reaches the thumb, place the thumb closer to the ear and repeat the squeezing action. You may need to do up to 3 steps before you reach the ear.<br>- After that, place both the thumb and the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; further down along your neck and repeat the squeezing technique. Work your way through the whole area you warmed up in action 1.</p><p>Repeat the 2nd action on the other side.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>As always in this business, it is better to do it gently rather than zealously.<br>Especially when you do it for the first time. Later, you will figure out the correct amount of power you can apply.</p><p><em>Have fun! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p>*Lymphedema is chronic tissue swelling that happens when the lymphatic transport capacity is exceeded.<br>**Tissue fibrosis is the phenomenon in which a tissue has a progressive deposition of collagen fibers with age.

Thereby:</p><p><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> Chronic pain of tension in the neck disappears,</p><p><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> Pain in the back of the head caused by nervous tension or fatigue often goes away,</p><p><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> The neck becomes smoother, develops a good habit of carrying the head proudly and straight,&nbsp;</p><p><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> Improves blood circulation and lymph flow in the tissues of the neck and face.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>It is almost impossible to harm yourself with this technique, even the deepest massage will only benefit, but keep in mind two important nuances.<br>First, the painful sensations during dispersion are quite normal. Areas of fibrosis can be painful. Do not spare yourself, but you do not need to try to stretch the &quot;stuck&quot; areas at any cost also. In this case, your guideline will be a pleasant, tolerable pain.<br>Second: the muscles may ache a little after such massage. This is the norm. You can relieve discomfort with a warm bath or compress.</p><p><strong>Technique:</strong><br>Keep your neck straight, point the top of your head upwards.<br>We need to unravel, disperse all the muscles in the back of the neck from the base of the skull to the weaving of the neck muscles into the trapezius muscles. We poke our fingers deep into the muscles and begin to pound them quite intensively. It is important not just to move the skin, but to grab the deep layers of the muscles. Try to feel the vertebrae with your fingertips and spread the muscles from the center to the periphery. Imagine that you are a sculptor who needs to sculpt the perfect neck.</p><p>Slowly move down, the deeper you work the muscles, the better result you can get.<br>Finger movements can be variable. Try circular kneading, pushing, grinding movements. You can squeeze the fold, hold it in your fingers for a few seconds and slowly release it.</p><p>Finish any rubbing movements with smoothing ones.</p><p>Pay special attention to the points behind the ears where the muscles attach to the base of the skull. This is the most likely area for fibrosis to form. Massaging this area can be especially painful at first. With practice, the pain will go away and only the most pleasant sensations will remain. Squeeze painful points with a smooth motion of your thumbs. Do not forget to work out a little the area in the corners of the jaw at the point of attachment of the SCSM.</p><p>Share your feelings in the comments. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f64f.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Everything worked out?

Now we are trying to keep the 4-7 cervical vertebrae upright, and rotate only the upper 1-3 vertebrae.<br>We stretch the top of our head up!&nbsp;<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f446.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f4aa.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>After we stretch the neck upward as much as possible, we begin to rotate our head at a very small amplitude, paying all attention to exactly stretching the muscles. The greatest stretch should be felt in the upper part of the neck, where the muscles are attached. We rotate very slowly, and feel how each muscle is stretched.<br>In some places, you can stop and pull harder and longer if you feel it is necessary.<br>We do 5 slow rotations in one direction, and then 5 in the other.<br>Perhaps you will hear the crunching of the vertebrae again. If it is not accompanied by pain, this is a variant of the norm. With regular exercise, the crunch will come to naught.</p><p>Attention!<br>The main thing is not to overdo it! There should be no tearing, sharp pain or tension that you want to stop as soon as possible. The stretch should be strong enough, but enjoyable. The muscles of the back of the neck, platysma, sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM), small muscles under SCM should be properly stretched.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

When we are young, these muscles lie flat from the cheekbones to the lower jaw... Because of the spasm, the muscles gather in one dense bump, pull the corner of the lower jaw upward, disrupting the performance of the mandibular joint, change the angle of inclination of the lower jaw, and the tissues of the cheeks are sagging down and displacing to the center.<br>Relaxing the chewing muscles helps to:<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; restore a clear oval of the face.<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; reduce or completely get rid of defects in the middle part of the face, such as: nasolabial folds, flabby sagging cheeks.<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; get rid of the habit of clenching teeth, due to which teeth will wear out less, prevention of bruxism.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>Massaging the chewing muscles can be painful both during execution and for a while after.

Warm up.<br>Start the massage by warming up the chewing muscles.<br>Perform it with the upper part of the palm (metacarpophalangeal joints, see picture below), with the pads at the base of the fingers.

The possible reason for it is that the orbital muscle has collected too much of residual spasm, got too small and too hard to grasp with fingers and pull up. In such case you will need more time to relax it with this delicate massage. Do not complain, count how many years you have been straining it, we do this natural relaxation in days, sometimes weeks.</p><p><strong>Technique:<br>1 step. Lower eyelid.</strong><br>Set the fingertip of the index finger on the lower eyelid in the inner corner of the eye. The tip should feel the bone and the eye both. With low amplitude light circling &nbsp;movement start massaging the orbital muscle of the eye. It is hard to feel it when the orbital muscle is relaxed, try to squint to feel it better. You need to massage all the way along it. About 10 massaging movements are enough in one place, move the tip to next point along the muscle. Work it out until you reach the outer corner of the eye.</p><p><strong>Important!</strong><br>Circular massaging movement are always up , towards periphery, down, back to start.</p><p><strong>2 step. Upper eyelid.</strong><br>Again, set your fingertip on the upper eyelid in the inner corner of the eye. Similarly do this massage on the upper part of the orbital muscle from inner to outer corner of your eye.</p><p>Surely repeat the sequence on the other side.</p><p>Good luck!<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

You need to work with it carefully and attentively to your feelings. Avoid strong stretching and uncomfortable pulling sensations.</p><p><strong>Technique:<br>1 Action. Warm up.<br>1 step. Preparation of the orbital area for work:<br></strong>With light massaging movements by the fingertips, go around the lower and upper eyelids, these can be tapping or slightly pressing movements. If, before this technique, you performed kneading the middle part of the face, then you can skip this step.<br><strong>2 step. Pushes.</strong><br>We push through the area around the eyeballs. Place the pads of the index fingers in the inner corner of the eye and lightly press just a couple of millimeters under the eyeball. Do not be afraid, it is not harmful! Hold this for 3-5 seconds, and then move your index fingers to the middle of the orbit. Press a little again and hold for 5-10 seconds. Gradually slide your finger along the lower orbit to the outer corner of the eye. When you are done with the lower eyelids, proceed in the same way to the upper ones.<br>Move from the center to the periphery.<br>This technique is also very effective if your eyes are overstrained from working at a computer for a long time, reading or driving a car.<br><strong>2 Action. Lymph drainage<br>1 step. Look down.</strong><br>We put the bases of our palms on the eyebrows, move them up a little, literally by 2-5 mm, look down (eyeballs look as much down as possible) and stay in this position for 4 deep inhale-exhale rounds.<br><strong>2 step. Look up.</strong><br>We put the bases of the palms on the orbital area below, shift the soft tissues a tiny bit down, not more than 2 mm, and look all the way up (the eyeballs look up as much as possible), and stay in this position for 4 inhale exhale rounds.<br>Return the tissues to original position.<br><strong>3 step. Kneading.</strong><br>Keep your eyes closed since you finished previous step and start kneading the entire orbital zone of the eyes over the eyelids with the bases of palms. When we do kneading we do not shift the tissue from their place, it is rather roller like movements that squeeze out excess of fluid from center to periphery. 3-5 such movements are normally enough.</p><p><strong>Attention.</strong><br>Just after you finished this techniques, it may seem to you that the dark circles under the eyes have become brighter and only got worse. Don&#39;t worry, this is a temporary effect caused by increased circulation in the orbital zone.

                        "exerciseDescription": "<p><strong>Frictions at the eyelid-cheek junction</strong></p><p>The orbital muscle of the eye, like other active facial muscles, tends to accumulate residual spasm and shorten with age. It literally shrinks to the center and falls under the eyeball. The tissues around the eyes become thinner, and the subcutaneous fat is gradually replaced by tough collagen fibers.<br>Visually, the eyes seem to fall inward, and on the border of the eyelid and cheek a distinct ridge is formed, which makes the eyes seem even older. With this technique, we will work out the tissues on the eyelid-cheek border, get rid of fibrosis and return the tissues to their former youthful volume!</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>The soft tissues in the orbital area are thin and delicate, they can react very differently to intense work. Pay attention to whether it became worse after the massages. If you suddenly find that there are more wrinkles under the eyes, or the eyes seem to have sunk even deeper, skip intensive work with the orbital area. It means that you do not get in grip the <strong>orbicularis oculi&nbsp;</strong>muscle and rub only skin. For now, &nbsp;spiral massage, lymph drainage and light kneading will be enough for you. You will be able to return to advanced eye area techniques when you restore good blood and lymph flow, and with it restore the metabolism process and tone of the skin.</p><p><strong>Technique:</strong><br>Place the index finger of one hand next to the inner corner of the eye on the border of the lower eyelid and cheek, and the other index finger next to the first at a distance of about half inch. Put them together so that a fold of underlying tissues is formed . Very carefully and gently start doing friction movements. Make about 10 light frictions at one place, and then reposition your fingers towards the middle of the eye. Repeat and again move your working fingers closer to the outer corner of the eye.<br>Try to work precisely with the tissues on the border of the eyelid and cheek, feel the very place where the thin skin of the eyelid turns into dense soft tissue. Grab the tissues deeper to catch the <strong>orbicularis oculi&nbsp;</strong>muscle into the grip. Depending on the state of your tissues, it can feel like an almost smooth transition or like a hard line falling inward.<br>If the fold of the soft tissues slips out of your fingers, don&#39;t worry, just grab it again, try to feel <strong>orbicularis oculi&nbsp;</strong>muscle and do the necessary amount of frictions.<br>Do not forget about the area in the outer corner of the eye, where your smile wrinkles start - crow&#39;s feet. There, the thin skin of the eyelids turns into the skin at the temples, and the orbital muscle of the eye intersects with the temporal muscle.</p><p><strong>2nd variation.</strong></p><p>You can do this technique with one hand. It will be even stronger. The main move here will the pinch. Try to get deeper between the eyeball and bone.</p><p>Avoid severe redness, do not squeeze too hard in an attempt to get rid of all the wrinkles at once. In this case, regularity is more important than intensity.<br>Even if you do not yet have obvious wrinkles and drooping of the lower eyelid, do not skip this technique. Wrinkles do not appear instantly, it takes years! The sooner you take care of the quality of the soft tissues in the orbital area, the longer you will not see wrinkles around your eyes.</p><p>Do it with pleasure and self-care! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60a.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Now we need to help the tissues to recover, gain a youthful volume and tone up.<br>Frictions of the upper eyelid are more difficult than it seems at first glance. You need to work very gently and carefully, attentively to sensations and changes.</p><p><strong>Technique:</strong><br>With your thumb and index finger, grab the small fold of soft tissues in the inner corner of your eye just above the eyeball. It may not be easy at the first try, but with practice you will definitely succeed. Make 5-10 light frictions, and then begin to gradually move towards the outer corner of the eye. Try to grab the fold in such a way that the thin orbital muscle (you can feel it if you squint) gets into it along the entire width from the border of the eyeball to the eyebrow. Massage the upper part of the orbital muscle of the eye from the inner corner of your eye to the outer corner of it.</p><p><strong>Important!</strong><br>Do one set for each eye! Not more that 1 time a day.<br>Delicate soft tissues of your eye need time for remodelling of their fibers.</p><p>Do not expect visible result fast, it comes with practice. But you will be happy to see the first improvements in your Photodiary in about a month. Take pictures. And share it! We all want to feel happy for you!</p><p>Clean open eyes - what makes us look younger for sure!&nbsp;<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Vertical frictions.</strong><br><strong>1.1</strong> Place your index finger so that it connects the outer tip of the eyebrow and the highest point of the cheekbone with one line - this will be the fixing finger. Put the index finger of the other hand parallel to it at a distance of about 1-1.5 cm - this will be the working finger. Grab a fold and start frictions with your working finger. 15-20 seconds will be enough!<br><strong>1.2</strong> Move the fixing finger slightly from the eye (at a distance of no more than half the thickness of your finger) and repeat all the same.<br><strong>1.3</strong> For the third fold, once again move the fixing finger the same distance as before closer to the hair growth zone on the temple. Here, the working finger can grab part of the hairy part of the temple, this is even good. If 3 folds were not enough to get to the hair growth zone, make another fold in the same way.<br><strong>Step 2. Diagonal frictions.</strong><br>Now repeat the same frictions, but change the angle of movement of the fingers: from the outer corner of the eye towards the ear.<br>Depending on the geometry of your face and the volume of the soft tissues, you should get 2-3 folds on each side towards the temple and 2-3 folds towards the ear.</p><p>The sensations from this massage are very pleasant. Take your time, do it slowly and thoughtfully, feel the tension go away from the temples and eyes.</p><p>Pleasure is an important factor! 😊</p><p>The more pleasant it is for you during the massages, the easier it will be for you to make them a part of your life! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Let&#39;s take a good look at F levators, especially at F1.</p><p><strong>2 action</strong>.<br>step 1. <strong>Compression</strong><br>With one index finger, we fix F1 at the level of the orbit, pressing the tissue tightly to the bone. With the second index finger, we press all soft tissue from the wing of the nose to the fixing one, forming a fold of tissues, while we think about the muscle and try to squeeze it. We hold the clamp for 20-30 seconds. (4 inhale-exhale rounds)</p><p>Step 2. <strong>Pressing</strong><br>We put both index fingers in the middle of F1 and sink them to the bone, hold the pressure for 5-10 seconds.</p><p>The task is to push the muscle in the middle, then stretching will follow.</p><p>In order not to be confused of the fact you could stretch the skin too much in step 3, you can push in, creating some additional skin fold for stretching beforehand.</p><p>Step 3. <strong>Stretching</strong><br>Without releasing the pressure, we stretch the F1 muscle towards its beginning and end very slowly. The upper finger slowly moves to the lacrimal canal, and the lower to the wing of the nose. Ideally, movement should last the same amount of time as compression. When the fingers have reached the end points, we continue to hold the pressure on them for another 5-10 seconds and release.</p><p>Step 4. <strong>Soothing the skin</strong><br>The top layers of the skin may look crumpled for a short time after such intense pressure and stretch marks. Let&#39;s help them find their rightful place as quickly as possible.</p><p>Using these light massage movements, you bring the skin back to the place where it is supposed to be. Pay attention to your sensations. After the first times you perform this massage, your muscle may ache a little, this is absolutely normal.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Good luck!<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

F2</strong></p><p>Now let&#39;s work on the F2 levator muscles.<br>The muscle that lifts the upper lip (F2) tenses when you doubt something very much or hear, for example, blatant lies))). Many people in this case skeptically raise their upper lip and cheek, they say: &ldquo;Well, well, come on, tell me! &quot; And these muscles are also involved in our big smile, they work when we chew or brush our teeth. They work constantly, which means they constantly accumulate residual spasm.<br>Because of this spasm, ugly nasolabial folds are formed, the lower eyelid sags, ugly plump ridges are outlined under the cheekbones, and lymph stagnation at the site of the spasm leads to enlarged pores and bumpy skin on these ridges.<br>This simple technique will help you get rid of annoying imperfections!</p><p><span class=\"fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"true\"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/608061753\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"fr-draggable\"></iframe></span><br></p><p><strong>Technique:</strong><br><strong>1 step</strong>. Compression.<br>We put our fingers on the attachment points of this muscle: the upper one is in the area of the center of the eye socket under the eye, the lower one is a fingertip away from the wing of the nose. We press with the fingertips deep into the muscle itself. Then hold pressure for 5 seconds, and then we move our fingers together and collect the fold. Hold it for 20 seconds or 4 inhale-exhale rounds. This extra tension will signal to the brain that the muscle needs to be completely relaxed.<br>Let it go.</p><p><strong>2 step</strong>. Stretching.<br>Now we reposition the fingertips in the middle of the muscle, collect a small fold for subsequent stretching and begin smoothly stretching of the F2 muscle. Hold the stretching for 5-15 seconds when you reach the attachment points of F2.</p><p><strong>3 step.</strong> Soothing the skin<br>The top layers of the skin may look crumpled for a short time after such intense pressure and stretch marks. Let&#39;s help them find their rightful place as quickly as possible.<br>Using these light massage movements, you bring the skin back to the place where it is supposed to be. Pay attention to your sensations. After the first times you perform this massage, your muscle may ache a little, this is absolutely normal.</p><p>Do the same on the other side!</p><p>One more step towards natural rejuvenation has been taken!<br><br>Good luck!&nbsp;<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f917.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>Alex</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

If the fold of soft tissues become thin and the F2 muscle slips out of it - collect it again.</p><p><strong>3 step.</strong> Stretching.<br>After frictions, you need to stretch the muscles well. To do this, press the beginning of F2 with the fixing fingertip tightly. Place the working fingertip right under the fixing one and press it in tightly then slowly pull the pressed soft tissues down a bit. Keep pressure. If the working fingertip have not yet reached the nasolabial fold, reposition the fixing fingertip on just stretched part of F2 and fix it next to the working fingertip. Again, with working fingertip press in and pull the soft tissues down stretching the F2. Stop when you reach the nasolabial fold.</p><p>Repeat the technique in the same way on the other side. One careful approach on each side is enough.<br>How does it feel?<br>Did you work with the muscles deeply?</p><p>Good luck!&nbsp;<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f917.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>Alex</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

                        "exerciseDescription": "<p><strong>Correction of the tear trough, nasojugal grove and midcheek furrow.</strong></p><p>Noticeable groove visually starting with tear trough, continuing with nosajugal crease and ending with midcheek furrow makes the face look very old! It is formed as a result of spasm and shortening of two muscle groups: F levators on one side and chewing muscles on the other. A groove lies between these two bundles of muscles, the tissues under it fibrosis and degrade. In the place of the crease, the skin becomes thinner. Our task is to disperse the tissues in the area of the this groove well, restore the volume of subcutaneous adipose tissue under it, and also shift the tissues &nbsp;up to where they were in their youth.</p><p><strong>Technique:</strong><br><strong>1 step</strong>. Tear trough rubbing.<br>First we fix the tissues of the lower eyelid so that the delicate skin under the eyes moves as little as possible and does not stretch. To do this, place the index finger on the lower orbit of the eye.</p><p>Next, we set two working fingers on the nasolabial fold next to the wing of the nose and move the entire tissue array upward, pressing the fold tightly against the fixing finger. With small-amplitude circling massaging movements, begin to thoroughly disperse the tissues, literally rubbing the fold between the fixing and working fingers. Circle motions are directed from center to periphery. &nbsp;20-30 seconds should be enough. If the fold slips out of the grip, collect it again.</p><p><strong>2 step</strong>. Nasojugal groove rubbing.<br>Now 2 fingers, index and middle, are fixing the lower eyelid.<br>Set the fingertips from the center of the orbit to the outer corner of the eye, the middle finger should rest just above the nasojugal crease. Working fingers start from the previous position, but the motion vector will be diagonal towards the 1st joint of the fixing middle finger.</p><p>It is important to work out exactly the array of soft tissues. On the contrary, to F2 frictions there is no need to push against the bone, but to rub the soft tissues between the fingers. At the end of the motion, the working fingers can dig under the middle fixing one, this is fine.</p><p>Also, 20-30 seconds should be enough to do this step.</p><p><strong>3 step</strong>. Midcheek furrow rubbing.<br>In the same manner, work on the area just below.<br>Fixing fingers stay in the previous position, and the working ones start from the corner of the mouth. Do the same circling massaging movements towards the 1st joint of the fixing finger for 20-30 seconds.</p><p><strong>4 step</strong>. Midcheek furrow rubbing with extension.<br>Replace the fixing fingers higher to the temple so that the fingertip of the middle finger would fix the outer corner of the eye. The working fingers start from the nasolabial fold next to the corner of the mouth. In the same manner, collect the fold and do the rubbing for 20-30 seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>Surely, massage the other side of your face with equal effort.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>Don&#39;t overdo it! Avoid severe redness of the skin and massage to bruises. It is necessary to work intensively, but carefully. Though, regularity is more important than intensity. If you think that after this massage the worked out area looks more sagging - let it relax for a day or 2 and definitely come back to it later. Recollect the baby power and half power rules for the next try.</p><p>Good luck! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f917.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> <br>Alex</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\"> <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"\"></a></p>",

                        "exerciseDescription": "<p><strong>Advanced lifting of the temporal facia with muscle fibers separation</strong></p><p>Here we come to get to know what is fascia. 🧐<br>Fascia is a band or sheet of connective tissue, primarily collagen, beneath the skin that attaches, stabilizes, encloses, and separates muscles and other internal organs.*<br>Temporal fascia surrounds temporal muscle. Due to its viscoelastic properties it can be stretched to accommodate needs of the organ. This stretching cannot happen as fast as muscle stretching. If left unattended, fascia increases its protective ability and looses elasticity, it can also build intercellular connections with neighbouring tissues. Even when we pull and stretch the muscle, the fascia gets stretched slowly. It takes quite a few regular stretching to return its elasticity and reposition to its origins. To separate temporal fascia from its neighbouring tissues we make small amplitude movements. And we do long pauses to remind the fascia its original state. With regular practice the muscles and its fasciae return to their righteous original position. To learn more about properties of fascia check out this free webinar from Tom Myers, this will set your mind in right direction. (<span style=\"color: rgb(44, 130, 201);\"><a href=\"https://www.anatomytrains.com/fascia-moves-webinar/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>link</u></a></span>)&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This technique will help to straighten the temporal muscles, relieve residual spasm from them and make your eyes open wider.</p><p>You will not believe your eyes how much the eyebrows and upper eyelids can rise in response to this technique. At first, the effect will be temporary, but with regular exercise, the eyebrows and upper eyelids will rise, and the youthful look will remain with you!</p><p><strong>Important!</strong><br>In this technique, it is very important to work with the temporal muscles, and not just pull the skin up. Make sure that the palms are firmly fixed on the muscles, do not allow a strong feeling of tension on the skin of the eyelids.</p><p><strong>Technique:<br>1 step. Fibers separation.</strong><br>Place the fingers, of both hands, on the temples with the little fingers just above the outer tips of the eyebrows. Press the soft tissue with your fingers almost to the bone and hold the pressure at the beginning of the temporal muscle for 5-15 seconds. Keeping the pressure, with vibrating small-amplitude massage movements, move your fingers towards the crown of the head. Press your fingers tightly through the muscles to the skull bone. Movements must be confident and fast enough. Stop vibrating when the bases of the palms are resting on the temples.<br>Maintain pressure with your fingers, and place your palms firmly on the temporalis muscle.<br><strong>2 step. Lifting the temporalis.</strong><br>Without letting go of your pressed palms, rest your elbows on the table or knees and relax your head and neck. Allow your head to slide slowly under its weight, maintaining the appropriate palm pressure (you already know how to do this from the basic technique).<br><strong>3 step. Pause before finishing.</strong><br>The movement will end when the fingers meet at the crown of the head. Do not rush to release the tension of the tissues, the longer you hold them, the better the effect (more than 1 minute, however, can be excessive).</p><p>Return to the starting position and do the technique again, shifting the trajectory of the vibrating movements closer to the ears.</p><p>2 times should be enough, but if you really like, you can make a third one shifting the trajectory of vibrational movements behind the ears.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>You work with the big temporalis muscle and its fascia, not with the skin of the temples or eyes. Do not grip the tissues of your eyes with the bases of your palms to avoid excessive tension on the skin of the eyes!</p><p>See the world with your eyes wide open!😳😁</p><p>*Marieb, Elaine Nicpon; Hoehn, Katja (2007).

Kneading</strong></p><p>Kneading is an excellent technique in order to warm up the tissues well and prepare them for subsequent manual techniques, in addition, it has a lymphatic drainage effect and is effective against imperfections that form in the middle part of the face: nasolabial folds, notable eyelid-cheek border, helps to make the cheekbones more outlined. This technique is familiar to you from the basic course &quot;Look younger&quot;, in this variation it is a bit deeper.<br><span class=\"fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"true\"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/543716230\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"fr-draggable\"></iframe></span></p><p><strong>Technique:</strong><br><strong>1 step</strong>. Zygomatic kneading.<br>We put the bases of the palms parallel to the nose, we rest against the cheekbones so that you feel the muscles under the skin. Hold on 5-10 seconds, and then begin rolling movement on the tissues (2-3 times in one place), gradually rearranging the palms from the center to the periphery. Rolling movements are alike a wheel going over a bump, the soft tissues should not shift from their places.</p><p>We call this kind of rolling movements - kneading. Keep kneading from nose to ears.</p><p><strong>2 step</strong>. Orbital kneading.<br>Return the palms to the nose and rearrange them higher on the orbital area and rest for 5-10 seconds. With very light rolling movements gently do kneading along the border of the lower eyelid, 2-3 times. You may increase up to 5 if you enjoy it ;).<br>And then , do kneading along the arch of the eye socket under the eyebrow. Also 2-3 times. We do kneading always from center to periphery.</p><p>Be careful, do not press too hard on the eyes and try not to pull on the delicate skin of the eyelids.</p><p><strong>3 step</strong>. Cheeks kneading.<br>Rearrange the palms down to the corner of the lips. Press in to feel the teeth and rest for 5-10 seconds. 2-3 times of kneading in this place are enough for regular practice, increase to 5 if you got dense array of tissues there.</p><p><strong>4th step</strong>. Jawline kneading.<br>Move your palms even lower. And with the bases of your palms, work the tissues from the chin along the jaw to the ears. 2-5 times, according to your sensations..</p><p><strong>Important!</strong><br>When you do kneading, you need to work in depth, without shifting the tissue in any direction.<br><strong>Always do kneading from center to periphery.</strong></p><p>Good luck!<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f917.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>Alex</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Let&#39;s go from nose to ear with both working fingers. We will do the massage with friction movements.<br>Set both fingers parallel to the nose, one right next to the nose, the other at a distance of 1-2 fingers from the first. We grab the fold, sliding our fingers together, and rub it until it slips out of the grip. 30-40 seconds maximum in one place. The tissues above the cheekbones are dense, so you can put more effort here. Gradually move along the cheekbone line to the very ear.<br>The tissue close to the ear is most difficult to pick up in the fold. Also, there, in the area of the temporomandibular joint, most often the tissues are fibrosed. These dense &quot;stuck&quot; areas prevent soft tissues of the middle part of the face from returning to the place where they were in their youth. Pay more attention to the area near your ears, take your time!<br>If the fold is picked up badly and slips out quickly, just pick it up again in the same place.<br>Depending on the geometry of your face, you can get 3, 4, and 5 folds. They can be massive and thick or thin, there can be painful sensations in the area of fibrosis. After the massage, you can feel how your face burns and vibrates from the inside. These are normal sensations!</p><p>Pay attention to the changes. If the redness does not go away for a long time, reduce the pressure on the tissue next time. If the swelling persists for a long time, work less intensely and finish the massage with lymphatic drainage stroking movements from the centre to the periphery.</p><p>Work the other cheek similarly.</p><p>How does it feel? How many folds did you manage to capture?</p><p>Good luck! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f917.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Alex</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Pre tension.<br>The working hand is the same on which side of the face the massage is done. If we start from the left cheek, then the working hand is left. The other hand fixes and carries out pre-tension of the tissues. Take the fixing hand over your head and grasp the soft tissues on the cheekbone and slide them up.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Pushing up.<br>Place the fingertips of the other hand under the cheekbone, push the soft tissue array to the bone and slide it up. Keeping the tension up, start moving left and right, thus, as if pushing the entire array of tissues to the fixing hand. As soon as the fingers of the working hand come close to the fixing one, rearrange the fixing one higher without releasing the tension. Continue the left-right movement of the working fingers until they approach the fixing ones again. Move the fixing hand even higher until the working one goes over the hairline.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Deeper grip.<br>Now you need to rearrange the fixing hand a little lower than the first time. This time, place the pads of the fingers, lower under the zygomatic bone in the area of the temporomandibular-facial joint. Pull the tissues up and hold the tension. This time it should be even stronger than the first one.<br>The working fingers also start moving slightly lower, from the nasolabial fold. As in the first step, move the soft tissue array upward and rest on the zygomatic bone. Start moving your fingers left-right, pushing the entire array of tissues to the fixing hand. In the same way, shift the fixing hand tension higher as the working fingers approach until they enter the hairy area.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Delay.<br>Do not hurry to release the tension of the fixing hand when the working one has done its job. Stay with this tension for 10-15 seconds, stretch the top of the head up as much as possible. Let the tissues &quot;recall&quot; their original place. Let go softly.</p><p>Be sure to do the same sequence on the other side.</p><p>You can finish the technique with the familiar exercise for lifting the temples and massage of the aponeurosis. This will enhance and consolidate the lifting effect!</p><p>Successful lifting!<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f917.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Alex</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

                        "exerciseDescription": "<p><strong>Vacuum massage for forehead&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Renewed skin with only the power of a small silicone cup!<br>The vacuum massage (VM) affects the secretion of collagen and elastin:<br>- skin gets rid of toxins and looks fresher;<br>- bags and dark circles under eyes disappear;<br>- pores shrink;<br>- wrinkles get smoothed.</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> Do not overdo it. After a vacuum massage (VM), the face should blush a little - this is called hyperemia. This is what we are trying to achieve. Light hyperemia will disappear within half a day, in a day at the very latest. However, if you &quot;work too hard&quot;, it may stay for several days. Be careful, this is your face after all!</p><p>There are contraindications to a vacuum massage:<br>- acute diseases and flare-up of chronic conditions;<br>- skin defects;<br>- thrombophlebitis (vein inflammation);<br>- increased fragility and vascular permeability (disrupted blood supply to soft tissues);<br>- severe cardiovascular disease (severe disease involving heart or blood vessels);<br>- mental disorders;<br>- age over 80.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- You need oil to perform this massage technique (see the oil guide). Use a silicon cup with a diameter of about 1 inch (2.5-3 cm). Put a few drops on your palms, rub them, and place your palms on your face. Also add some oil on the cup&#39;s working surface directly for better gliding. ⠀<br>- No need to create a strong vacuum!<br><strong>1. Action</strong> - suction.<br>- Create a vacuum with a cup by grabbing the cup between your thumb and index finger and squeezing it. Press it to your skin and then let it go. This would create a vacuum that sticks the cup to your face by picking up the skin underneath.<br>-Leave the cup sticking to your skin for 5 to 10 seconds.<br>- Repeat this action several times on different parts of your forehead.<br><strong>2. Action</strong> - circular movements.<br>- Press the squeezed cup to your skin creating the vacuum. The cup should be able to move without losing the vacuum &ndash; this is exactly what you need. 2 to 3 circular movements on one spot, then you can move on to the next part of your forehead and repeat the action.<br><strong>3. Action</strong> - horizontal movements.<br>- Press the squeezed cup to your skin creating the vacuum and drag the cup horizontally across your forehead. If the cup has lost the vacuum, create the vacuum and continue from the same place. Vertical movements are also possible.</p><p>- The time you spend on every area is very individual and depends on the sensitivity of your skin, on how much vacuum you created and so on. Perform the massage until your skin is slightly red. No more and no less.</p><p><strong>Important !⠀</strong><br>Make sure to wash off the oil or other massage product afterwards! Don&#39;t leave it on your skin.<br>During the vacuum massage, the skin releases many substances that will not have a beneficial effect on it! These substances must be removed from the skin, otherwise it can result in irritation, redness or skin peeling off.<br>Make sure that the vacuum you create is minimal!<br>Do not try to pull too much skin into the cup.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Be gentle with yourself,</em><br><em>Good luck! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p>Move on to the VM for middle face.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

After a vacuum massage (VM), the face should blush a little - this is called hyperemia. This is what we are trying to achieve. Light hyperemia will disappear within half a day, in a day at the very latest. However, if you &quot;work too hard&quot;, it may stay for several days. Be careful, this is your face after all!</p><p>There are contraindications to a vacuum massage:<br>- acute diseases and flare-up of chronic conditions;<br>- skin defects;<br>- thrombophlebitis (vein inflammation);<br>- increased fragility and vascular permeability (disrupted blood supply to soft tissues);<br>- severe cardiovascular disease (severe disease involving heart or blood vessels);<br>- mental disorders; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>- age over 80.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- You need oil to perform this massage technique (see the oil guide). Use a silicon cup with a diameter of about 1 inch (2.5-3 cm). Put a few drops on your palms, rub them, and place your palms on your face. You can also add some oil on the cup&#39;s base directly for better gliding. ⠀<br>- No need to create a strong vacuum!<br><strong>1. Action</strong> - suction.<br>- Create a vacuum with a cup so that the cup sticks well to your skin and leave it for 5-10 seconds there. Start the VM of the middle face from the area next to your nose, then move on to the next place toward your ear and repeat the action.<br><strong>2. Action</strong> - circular movements.<br>- Press the squeezed cup to your skin creating the vacuum. The cup should be able to move without losing the vacuum &ndash; this is exactly what you need. 2 to 3 circular movements on one spot, then you can move on to the next part of your face and repeat the action.<br>- In the middle face, the skin is more flexible than on the forehead, so that the circular movements should be done more careful! If in doubt, skip the action 2 and go straight to the action 3.<br><strong>3. Action</strong> - horizontal movements.<br>- Press the squeezed cup to your skin creating the vacuum and drag the cup horizontally from the nose to your ear and slightly upward. If the cup has lost the vacuum, create it again and continue from the same place.<br>- Working on the middle face, you can only perform horizontal motions from nose to ear.<br>- The time you spend on every area is very individual and depends on the sensitivity of your skin, on how much vacuum you created and so on. Perform the massage until your skin is slightly red. No more and no less.</p><p><strong>Important!⠀</strong><br>Make sure to wash off the oil or other massage product afterwards! Don&#39;t leave it on your skin.<br>During the vacuum massage, the skin releases many substances that will not have a beneficial effect on it! These substances must be removed from the skin, otherwise it can result in irritation, redness or skin peeling off.<br>Make sure that the vacuum you create is minimal! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60e.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>Do not try to pull too much skin into the cup.</p><p><em>Listen to your sensations,&nbsp;</em><br><em>See you in a bit! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</em></p><p>Move on to the VM for lower face.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

                        "exerciseDescription": "<p><strong>Laying on the roller</strong></p><p>Unique, easy, relaxing and super effective exercise to release spasms in your spine inner muscles and improve neck static. &nbsp;Look at the picture, look at the muscles supporting the spine from outside and inside (long muscle of the neck, lat. &quot;longus colli&quot;) of the spine bone, they connect vertebrae one to others. What? Do you think happens, when they get into spasmodic state? They cement the curves of the spine that actually we need to straighten for the sake of better wellbeing and rejuvenation.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>We can&#39;t reach the anterior surface of the spine with hands to massage them. These inner muscles can be relaxed only by prolonged stretching, not shorter than 5 minutes. Even in yoga, you will not find the poses that can help their relaxation effectively. Only laying on the rolls can really help in relaxing inner spine muscles to improve the situation around 7th cervical vertebra, which normally sticks out with ageing.&nbsp;</p><p>Technique is simple, but there are precautions:<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is not for pregnant<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; Coming out of this exercise should be VERY slow and delicate because you stretch your spine, so fast jump out from the pose can cause lumbago.<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; You may &nbsp;fall asleep in this pose. This is OK. Just come out of it even slower.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>1. Make roll from a bath towel. Fold it twice along its length, roll and tie it up with a ribbon. You can adjust thickness and hardness of the roll according to your need by softening or tightening the ribbon. For the beginning, start with loosen ribbon.</p><p>2. Prepare the place on the flat solid surface like a floor, make sure that you get no wind over there. Use yoga mat or a rag to lay on.</p><p><strong>1 action.</strong> Under the lower back. 5-10 minutes.<br>Sit with the crossed legs, place the roll under the lower back perpendicular to it. Lay down on the mat, straiten your legs and relax. Heels are at the same width as your shoulders, arms stretched out over your head. Relax and breathe evenly. Relax in this pose for 5-10 minutes.<br>To make the stretching deeper, connect your big toes, keeping the heels on the same spots, and put your palms on the floor over your head with elbows pointing upwards.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT.</strong> Coming out of the pose is very slow. First, turn your body on the side and pull out the roll from the lower back. If you finished the exercise, slowly get onto your hands and knees and do simple bands of the spine, then slowly get up on the feet.</p><p><strong>2 action.</strong> Under the middle of the back. 5-10 minutes.</p><p>From the previous action pose turn on your side and adjust the roll higher, to the middle of the back, again perpendicular to the spine, and again lay on it and relax. &nbsp;For deeper stretching, do the same toes connection and palms set on floor. Relax for 5-10 minutes.<br><strong>IMPORTANT.</strong> Coming out of the pose is very slow.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3 action</strong>. Under the shoulder blades perpendicular. 5-10 minutes.</p><p>From the previous action pose turn on your side and adjust the roll higher, under the shoulder blades, again perpendicular to the spine, and again lay on it and relax. &nbsp;For deeper stretching, do the same toes connection and palms set on floor. Relax for 5-10 minutes.<br><strong>IMPORTANT.</strong> Coming out of the pose is very slow.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4 action.</strong> Between the shoulder blades, along the spine. 5-10 minutes.</p><p>From the previous action pose turn on your side and change orientation of the roll, this time set it along the spine, between your shoulder blades. One end of the roll should be at the 7th cervical vertebra area, so that the cervical vertebrae and head would be lower than the rest of the spine resting on the roll. Relax on the roll. &nbsp;</p><p>For deeper stretching relaxation of the inner spine muscles, do few swings of arms in opposite directions. One arm along the body, the other is stretched straight over your head, change their positions. Try to do 10 swings like this, then relax for 5-10 minutes. Do the same toes connection and palms set on floor for deeper stretching if you fell like it.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT.</strong> Coming out of the pose is very slow. First, turn your body on the side. Slowly get on all fours and do simple backbends, then slowly get to your feet.</p><p>Relaxation on the roll should be very deep, you may get sleepy easily. Do not let yourself fall asleep, especially when you just start practising this technique.</p><p><strong>Feeling sleepy?</strong> Make a couple of deep breaths and turn on your side, remove the roll from under your body and enjoy pleasant relaxation in your back. Always keep in mind that you have relaxed your spine very well, vertebrae got to forgotten positions and got stretched out from each other a bit, restructuring to the healthier spine state. This healthy state of spine got forgotten by the tissues surrounding your vertebrae. If you return very fast to the regular vertical position, some little tissues may get clamped by vertebrae just a bit. This bit can cause a giant pain, so be careful when you get up. When you do it slowly, with awareness, all the tissues will find their righteous places, and you will feel just great!</p><p><br></p><p>Love your spine and live long happy life! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Chewing muscles are the largest on the face and impact the shape of the face in general. It is hard to see direct impact of the relaxation of this group but in the long run rejuvenation training it is highly important to keep them relaxed together with other facial muscles. It is essential for deeper relaxation of the whole face in order to treat bothering wrinkles effectively.</p><p>Recommended flow:<br>1. Keep doing morning exercises as usually.<br>2. Check out new exercises.<br>3. Practice your set of already learned exercises.<br>4. Practice new ones.</p><p>Do not worry if you miss a day of study. You can always catch up. New exercises will be added to your Plan For Today, you will not miss them.</p><p>Good luck! 🙂</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\"> <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"\"></a></p>",

Perform the exercise either on moist skin or ideally after applying a day cream or tonic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- You will need your both hands for this technique. Place the inner edge of your palms on the sides of your nose. The knuckles of your index fingers should be placed at the corners of your lips. The thumbs should meet under the chin area.

After you reach the collarbones, on the exhalation, press in your fingers under the collarbone for 1 to 2 seconds.<br>- Repeat the exercise 2 to 3 times.

If you have any chronic medical conditions or have recently had a surgery, please do not jump.<br>Pregnant women should also not jump.</p><p>Ladies, hold your breast while jumping.<br>If you are overweight, you should start with easy jumping, which means a low jumping height and a lower number of jumps. You can increase the height and the number, when you feel like it.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- Find a free space with a solid floor.<br>- Go on your tiptoes and let your body weight fall naturally on your heels. Continue these jumps, gradually increasing the jumping height and the speed.<br>- Do about 30 to 40 jumps the first time. You can gradually increase the number of jumps up to 100 on the following days of practice.</p><p><strong>Important!</strong><br>Do not lift your toes off the floor, it is not necessary to bounce, but to hit the floor with your heels.

Our goal is to get our bodies to start vibrating to improve the &nbsp;blood circulation from blood vessels to capillaries. So, you normally shouldn&rsquo;t feel tired afterwards.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>Find a suitable spot where you can move freely in one place.<br>Simply start running in place. No need in big or sharp movements. It is much more important to slightly hop from one foot to another. That is the minimum you should try to perform. You can add some movements to your arms, too, if you want to boost the effect. Keep running for about a minute. Breathe evenly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>Do not tense any part of your body. Relax your shoulders, arms and hands.

                        "exerciseDescription": "<p><strong>Head rotations</strong></p><p>This is an amazing exercise which is going to help you return mobility to your neck! It is a basic exercise that you need to have always at your disposal.&nbsp;</p><p>This exercise:</p><p>- improves your neck zone (cervical spine) functional mobility;</p><p>- warms up your neck muscles;</p><p>- dissolves possible congestion in the cervical zone;</p><p>- restores the physiological tone of the neck muscles back to normal;</p><p>- corrects the neck static;</p><p>- prevents osteochondrosis and arthritis in the neck area.</p><p><strong>Caution:&nbsp;</strong>You can practice it any time of the day in any convenient situation. Do it before you start with other neck exercises and also after it. But start by doing it very very gently.</p><p>If you are doing it for the first time in your life, you may be surprised by cracking sounds and possible sudden aches.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The technique:</strong></p><ul><li>Don&rsquo;t forget to control your breathing while doing any exercise. Deep inhale and then long exhale without pauses.</li><li>Stand up straight, let your arms hang down relaxed, and reach upwards with the top of your head and relax.&nbsp;</li><li>Let&rsquo;s call it the crown of your head. It is also a nice to imagine that you have something very important on your head <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f607.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> .</li><li>Then slowly drop your head as if you would try to touch your chest with the chin while exhaling.&nbsp;</li><li>Start to move your crown to the left and upwards doing semicircle while inhaling until your head gets to the position when the back of it looks down and you look up.</li><li>Continue the rotation from this position while exhaling by pointing your crown to the right then drop your chin down again. Imagine the crown drawing circles over your head.&nbsp;</li><li>Continue rotations to the right and do it 4 more times. Do not speed up! Keep doing it gently even if you feel alright after the first circle.</li><li>Do the same rotations to the left side. 5 times.&nbsp;</li><li>Keep doing it slowly and gently.</li><li>The larger circles you can draw with your crown, the more flexible and prepared for further exercises your neck is.</li></ul><p><strong>Attention!&nbsp;</strong>The technique is simple but please pay much attention to what you feel while doing the exercise. Any sharp pain can be a signal to cervical spine osteochondrosis. In that case you have to be very careful and attentive to your neck area. Any other exercise for your neck should be done very gently.&nbsp;</p><p>Do not ask me to diagnose what can be wrong with your neck, I am not a doctor. Besides, in that case, you need to see a doctor in person to get the correct diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Tale:&nbsp;</strong>PLEASE DO NOT THINK THIS IT IS NOT YOUR CASE!&nbsp;</p><p>I made this mistake when I did this neck exercise for the first time at the age of 40, 8 years after my last yoga class. I thought I was still flexible enough and stretching my neck would be an easy task.</p><p>It WAS! &nbsp;Very easy... <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f62d.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; BUT I ended up with a lumbago in my neck area which kept me from doing any other neck exercises for the next half a year. I had to downgrade it and go through a rehabilitation course to return mobility, strength and healthy feeling in the neck. This course is now called &quot;Take it easy&quot;, it consists of 20 easy exercises aimed at returning the mobility to your spine, and you can find this amazing course in the app.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Extra:&nbsp;</strong>Head rotations can be done in a sitting position, too. The standing position is more<em>&nbsp;</em>preferred just because all the following neck exercises are done from a standing position.</p><p><em>Good luck!</em> <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Have you tried?</strong></p><p>I bet you have heard many interesting sounds by now! :)) &nbsp;Clicks, crunching and even cracks are kind of normal... They are even normally expected.</p><p>I have been doing this exercise every day for past 4 years. My neck still does some clicking and crunching from time to time, but a lot less than before and I am no longer having any concerns about getting a lumbago.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Got sudden pain? Do not hesitate to consult your doctor!</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

It is crucial for the result.</p><p>The word &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; here means a slight pressure against the main movement.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong></p><p><strong>1 Action</strong>. Head back on hump</p><p>- Stand in the upright position with the crown pointed upward.</p><p>- Lock your hands together behind your lower back. Lift the locked hands upward as high as you can while keeping your arms straight. Your trapezoid muscles would shape up to a hump.</p><p>- Use the hump as a base for your head, slowly let your head drop on the hump.</p><p>- Stay in this position for 4 inhale-exhale rounds.&nbsp;</p><p>- After exhaling for the 4th time, slowly start moving your head upwards while inhaling.&nbsp;</p><p>- Fix your head in the upright position for a couple of seconds and move on to stretching.</p><p><strong>2 Action</strong>. Stretching</p><p>- Lift your hands, lock them together with your fingers and place them on the back of your head.</p><p>-You&rsquo;ll feel the weight of your arms slightly pushing your head down. Allow it to do so, but DO NOT push it down with strength. Just the weight of your arms is enough to do the trick.</p><p>- Tilt your head down, feel the tension in the back of the neck, relax your arms.</p><p>- Stay in this position for the next 4 inhale-exhale rounds.&nbsp;</p><p>- Control your breathing. Breathe evenly in and out, do not hold the breath.</p><p><strong>3 Action</strong>. Compensation</p><p>- After the last exhaling, while inhaling you slowly start moving your head upwards with your locked hands compensating for this movement with slight resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>- Fix your head in a perfectly upright position. The head is slightly pushing against your locked hands.</p><p>- Stay in this position for 2 inhale-exhale rounds. Breathe deep and evenly.</p><p><strong>Repeat</strong> the actions 2 and 3 for 2 inhale-exhale rounds each.</p><p>- Close your eyes for a few seconds and feel your neck and its new position.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Attention!</strong></p><p>No pressure on the head, while it is tilted toward the chest. Just the weight of your arms should perform the natural pressure. If you think, your hands might be too heavy, you should be especially careful and try to compensate for the natural pressure in order to make it lighter.</p><p>This exercise is good on its own, but you should never skip it out when doing the neck complex.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Take it easy!&nbsp;</em><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Sides</strong></p><p>Basics, basics for every day!<br>Exercise on the sides of your neck.</p><p>- Your neck gets long and strong;</p><p>- The side muscles of your neck are relaxed and better supplied with blood;</p><p>- Tension in your shoulders is reduced;</p><p>- Your head&rsquo;s supply with blood also improves, which results in a relief of headaches and shoulder pain.</p><p><strong>Caution:&nbsp;</strong>If you do it correctly, you will feel comfortable at any time while exercising.<br>Slow and gentle movements are the key to a healthy neck in this exercise.<br>The word &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; here means a slight pressure against the main movement.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong></p><p><strong>1 Action</strong>. Hump</p><p>- Stand in the upright position, stretch your crown upwards, relax your shoulders and arms.</p><p>- Put your right hand on your waist so that your arm and a bodyside would make a triangle. Now stretch the long side of this triangle by lifting the right shoulder as high as possible. Your trapezoid muscle should make a hump.</p><p>- Use this hump as base for your neck and your head, tilt your head slowly toward the uplifted shoulder. Your neck must firmly meet with the hump that you created with your trapezoid muscle, the ear may not necessarily touch the shoulder - it is not what we are aiming for. The goal is to get a slight pressure of the contracted trapezoids on the right side of your neck.</p><p>- Control your breathing. Breathe smoothly. Try to make your breathing in and out equally long.&nbsp;</p><p>- Keep this position for 4 deep inhale-exhale rounds; Return your head to the upright position and let your strained arm relax, spot the difference in sensations to the opposite side.</p><p><strong>2 Action</strong>. Stretching</p><p>- Keep your head in the upright position. Put your left hand over the head as if you were trying to grab your right ear. Let your left palm rest on the right side of your head.</p><p>- Tilt your head slowly to the left &ndash; the opposite side of where you made a hump previously. The hump and the neck are getting stretched now.</p><p>- The hand rests on your head without any tension, keep it relaxed. The hand performs slight pressure using its own weight only. Do not push!</p><p>- Relax the shoulder of the arm that rests on your head.</p><p>- Control your breathing. Breathe smoothly. Try to inhale and exhale equally long.&nbsp;</p><p>- Keep this position for the next 4 deep inhale-exhale rounds.</p><p><strong>3. Action</strong>. Compensation</p><p>- Return the head slowly in the upright position. The hand now is compensating the return action of the head, keeping the neck in the stretched state. Let the palm be in the same place until the very end of the action.</p><p>When your head is straight up with your hand compensating it with a slight pressure, keep this compensating pressure for the next 2 rounds of breathing in and out. Both the head and the hand &laquo;want&raquo; to keep the head in the perfectly upright position.</p><p>Start slowly with the stretching action again. Stay in the stretched position for 2 inhale and exhale rounds. Return your head to the upright position with the compensating pressure by your hand.</p><p>Now let your hand down. Relax. Close your eyes for 5 seconds and spot the difference between the left and the right side.</p><p>Repeat the sequence for the other side of your body.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong></p><p>As with all neck exercises, perform it very slowly&nbsp;and be attentive to your sensations. If you do it right and keep your neck as long as possible in every position, you are not going to experience any discomfort.</p><p>! DO NOT try to reach shoulders with your ears. This can cause serious troubles to your neck; it is not the action we need.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Tale:</p><p>Well, I do this exercise every day. At least once in the morning as a part of the neck complex. I also do it any other time of the day when I feel discomfort in the neck-shoulder area. It is a great relaxation technique!</p><p><br></p><p>Have you tried?</p><p>What were your sensations in the left and right side before you did the opposite side?</p><p><br></p><p><em>Take care of your neck!&nbsp;</em><br><em>It is the pedestal for your pretty face</em> <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f64f.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Trapezius</strong><br>Stretching the trapezius muscles.</p><p>- Your head posture improves;</p><p>- The neck gets longer and stronger;</p><p>- Tension in shoulders is released;</p><p>- Your head&rsquo;s supply with blood also improves;</p><p>- The better feeling in the body as a whole. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> Please perform this exercise slowly and gently. Remember, be especially careful if you never trained your neck muscles, we don&rsquo;t want to risk a lumbago. If you do the technique correctly, the neck will only get stronger and longer.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong></p><p><strong>1. Action</strong>. Rest on the hump</p><p>- Stand up in the upright position with a hand on your waist, your thumb looking down and your middle finger pointing to the spine bone. Your palm is resting on the part of your body where you suppose your kidney. Move your elbow backwards. Your arm and the bodyside would make a triangle. Now stretch the long side of this triangle by lifting your shoulder as high as possible. Your trapezius muscles should make a hump. This hump will be the base for the back of your head. Now turn your head in the opposite direction to the hump and look upwards. The back of your head should comfortably rest on the hump. No extra tension here.<br>- Stay in this position for 4 inhale-exhale rounds. Breathe evenly.</p><p><strong>2. Action</strong>. Stretching</p><p>- Return your head to the upright position and let your strained arm relax.<br>- With the other hand, take the back of your head, so that your wrist lies on the top of the head and fingers are pointing down. Ideally, the elbow would look outstretched. The hand here controls the following stretching.<br>- Tilt your head towards the chest, then move it slowly to the armpit of your controlling arm. Stretch your chin towards the armpit. Stay in this position for 4 inhale-exhale rounds. Breathe evenly, feel the muscles being stretched, starting from your skull and ending in your shoulder.</p><p><strong>3. Action</strong>. Compensation</p><p>- Return your head to the upright position by going the same way back. The controlling hand compensates the movement, which has the effect of slowing down the return movement with its natural weight.<br>- Stay in the upright position for the next 2 inhale-exhale rounds. The controlling hand is fixing the head and doesn&rsquo;t let it go backwards. Yet the all-up tension would be pointed up.</p><p>Repeat the stretching and fixing sequence and hold it for 2 inhale-exhale rounds each.&nbsp;</p><p>Repeat the sequence for the other side of your body.</p><p>It is the last exercise of the neck complex. It is advisable to do the <strong>head rotations after</strong> it.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong></p><p>The controlling hand is for control only. Do not push while stretching. Its own weight is just enough pressure. If you think your hand might be too heavy, do not let all of its weight lay on your head. Listen to your body and try to find the right pressure.</p><p>Do the neck complex of exercises every day, and soon you will be amazed at how much longer your neck would become.<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f642.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>Take care! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

It is a static exercise, looks easy, but you must try yourself before you can judge. Performing it for the first time, try to do it for a minute, then you can gradually increase the duration, ideally up to 10 minutes a day.</p><p>Benefits:<br>- Neck posture is improved.<br>- The neck gets long and strong.<br>- You will find the real straight posture for your spine.<br>- Oxygen consumption increases as your lungs can intake more air in this pose.<br>- Nerve system is strengthened.</p><p><strong>Caution:&nbsp;</strong>This exercise is not suitable for pregnant women.<br>You may feel dizzy, you may experience trembling in your calves and arms.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- Find a clean wall, ideally without a baseboard, so that your heels can touch the same surface that your head will lean on. There should be enough space over your head, so you can move upwards freely.</p><p>- Stand against the wall with your back to the wall. Your heels, calves, buttocks, back shoulder blades should be touching the wall.</p><p>- Straighten up your neck and point your &laquo;crown&raquo; upwards, lean the back of your head on the wall and look straightforward. You can close your eyes during the exercise, if you feel like it.</p><p>- Relax. Let all your muscles release the tension, only some muscles in the back are compensating this relaxation and keep your spine straight against the wall.</p><p>- While relaxing, keep your calves, back shoulder blades and the back of the head well attached to the wall. Correct the position, if they are not.</p><p>- Flatten your body gradually against the wall while keeping it relaxed. Your arms should be hanging relaxed.</p><p>If you are the one to go for 10 minutes every day - you are probably the king of posture! After a month of practice, you should check your height, don&rsquo;t be surprised, if you get half an inch taller.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>If you are overweight then getting your heels, calves and buttocks to touch the same surface would be difficult. In this case, step away from the wall just a bit, but surely keep your buttocks, back shoulder blades, and the back of the head to the surface.<br>You can get some strange sensations across your body, which are normally expected for beginners. It could be trembling, itching, a slight numbing in your legs and arms. It will gradually subside every day. One day you will find yourself resting in this pose, I promise.&nbsp;<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like a new person every time after this exercise.

Our body structures grow together, forming connective tissues in the wrong place or in excess of its healthy amount.</p><p>This process is also called <strong>tissue fibrosis</strong>.</p><p>Exactly the same process can occur with the GA. Our goal is to restore the mobility to the GA so that the tissues can return to their right place. When the GA is not flexible enough, the skin formed to folds and wrinkles on the neck and face wouldn&rsquo;t return to its original position... So, please take this exercise very seriously!</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- At first, we make an easy test. Press any place on your scalp with your index finger (frontal part where your hair starts to grow, crown, nape, or the most stubborn place behind the ears) and try to move the skin crosswise (right, left, forward, backward).<br>Does it move in all directions? How much does it shift? Does it shift at all the places?<br>Ideally, the shift should be about half an inch in each direction. The GA massage will bring you to these great results.</p><p>- The technique is simple and variable; you can take this massage creatively. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; Our goal is to return mobility.<br>- You can use all your fingers, 8 or 10 as you wish. Place them on your scalp at any convenient place to start with and press the skin with your fingers to the skull. Start with crosswise movements&nbsp;(right, left, forward, backward). 2 to 3 will be enough, then you can move further to the nearby area about 1 inch further.<br>- Perform this technique all over the skull, all the hairy part of your head (including the parts where the hair growth has decreased).<br>- If you come across the parts that are completely resistant to a crosswise shift, you can try other massage movements: circular, shift to one side, pushing. There is room for creativity. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f44d.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>- Harming yourself with this technique is virtually impossible, but the benefits from this exercise would grow in progression to your efforts.<br>- Ideally, the skin on the scalp should move along with the fingers. If your fingers slide a little through the hair, nothing wrong with it, it&rsquo;s even useful for stimulating the hair growth. With GA massage, the blood supply to the hair follicles is significantly improved, the hair becomes stronger and grows faster.</p><p><strong>Common question:</strong><br>Can this massage make my hair fall out? I treat them with care ... <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f636.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>Answer: The weak hair that you would lose anyway soon, may fall out. But it is a good thing, because new, healthier hair will grow there, if you keep doing the GA massage every day. The hair follicles are provided with a better nutrition, so that your hair would recover and grow fast. We have been seeing many happy followers whose hair growth has been restored. Take a look at our model, he is 45 years old, he has been practicing the GA massage (in different variations) since the age of 18, his hair is still thick as in his young years.</p><p>Practice well and enjoy!<br><em>Good luck!&nbsp;</em><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

The muscle is contracted when you are concentrating for a long time, or when you are making a serious face. It helps you to look more serious but leaves unwanted lines right in the middle of your face. Now it&rsquo;s time to relax it and smooth the marks the life left on your face.<br>- It is a great and also easy technique to bring the procerus muscle back in its original shape.<br>- Nose bridge lines are getting smoothed.<br>- Frown lines are smoothed too.<br>- Habit to frown is reduced.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br><strong>1st step</strong>. Press into the muscles<br>- Use your both index fingers for this technique. Place your fingertips side by side on the bridge of the nose and press them into the muscle to the bone. Press hard, in this exercise you are allowed do so. Feel the pressure and hold it for 10 seconds.<br>- Slowly pull the fingertips apart until the eyebrows.<br>- Repeat the motion 3 to 5 times.<br><strong>2nd step</strong>. Roll out<br>- Place your index fingers horizontally one over another. The hand of the upper finger would point up, and the one of the lower finger would point down. Place the fingers on the nose bridge with some pressure.<br>- Roll the fingers so that the hands would change the position from pointing up to pointing down and vice versa.<br>- After the rolling movement is finished, stretch this area by pulling the fingers apart a little.<br>- You can repeat the 2nd step 2 to 3 times.</p><p>All in all, it wouldn&rsquo;t take more than one minute.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>For this exercise you won&rsquo;t&nbsp;need any oils. You need a good grip on your skin.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Good luck! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p>*The frontal muscle (&lsquo;musculus frontalis&rsquo; in Latin) is a muscle which covers parts of the forehead.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

In this exercise, you learn how to work with your fingers deep and slow. When we say &quot;slow,&quot; it really means slow, about one millimetre in 5 seconds.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- Place your elbows on a table. Let the weight of your head lean the hooks. The back of your neck should be relaxed.<br>- Form your index fingers to &ldquo;hooks&rdquo;. Place both fingers on the nose bridge and push deep down to the bone. Feel the tissues for 10 to 20 seconds.<br>- One &ldquo;hook&rdquo; is the fixing one, you don&#39;t move it. The other one is the working one, you do move it, but very slowly, from the middle of your forehead towards the middle of your eyebrow.<br>- Return the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; to the start position. Repeat the action for the other side.<br>- Place the &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; a bit higher than your nose bridge. Now you can put them side by side with the finger joints touching each other. Push them in to the bone and keep them like this for 10 to 20 seconds. Compare your sensations to the previous position.<br>- Repeat the same slow movements using your working &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; for about 1 inch (2.5 centimetres)<br>- Place your &ldquo;finger hooks&rdquo; further up again. You may need to do it several times before you reach the hairline.

No oil required for this technique. Remember the Baby-Power Rule while working with face and especially near your eyes. Eyelids are very sensitive tissues; they may be harmed easily when treated incautiously.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br><strong>1&nbsp;</strong>Action. <strong>Warm-up</strong><br>- Make a fold out of the soft tissues of your eyebrow and the ones surrounding it, including the puckering eyebrow muscle using both hands. Start with massaging pinching-like movements with light friction, moving along the superciliary arch* from your nose bridge to the middle of the eyebrow.<br><strong>2&nbsp;</strong>Action. <strong>Stretching</strong><br>- Make the same fold starting from the nose bridge. Start stretching the eyebrow muscle. The one hand is the fixing one, the other one is the pulling one. Pull the soft tissues along the fold towards the end of the eyebrow. The fold is thought to be about half inch long (1,5 cm). Place the fixing hand further to the end of your eyebrow and make another fold. You may need to do up to 3 folds one after another before you reach the middle of the eyebrow. Perform the pulling technique on every fold.</p><p>Repeat the sequence on the other side.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>Do not overdo it, please. If you do it right, it takes about a minute for each side.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Take care! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p>*superciliary arch - a brow ridge of the frontal bone above the eye socket.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

It can easily get harmed. Please remember in this exercise about the one-year-old baby power rule. Working on the eye area, imagine how gently a baby would touch the face, use the same power.</p><p>Check out what muscle you will work on</p><p><span class=\"fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"true\"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/543693547\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"fr-draggable\"></iframe></span><br></p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br><strong>1st step</strong>. Warm-up<br>- Use all your fingertips for this warm-up technique. Perform a massage on the whole lower eyelid area, slightly pressing in the infraorbital margin* bones. 30 seconds would be enough for the warm-up.<br><strong>2nd step</strong>. Frictions of lower eyelid<br>- Use your both index fingers. Make a little vertical fold of the soft tissues of the lid-cheek junction. You can grab about half an inch (1-1,5 cm) of soft tissues of the lower eyelid and below it, but please, do not squeeze it!<br>- Perform the massage on the fold, doing frictions very patiently and carefully. Take your time.<br>- When the fold slips out during the friction, make another fold in the next area, moving towards the end of the eye socket. Perform the same friction technique patiently. Work your way through the whole area. You can make up to 10 folds on each side, if you want to work the whole way through the eye area thoroughly and patiently. It is up to you. Listen to your sensations and the way your soft tissues respond, but do not overdo it.<br><strong>3d step</strong>. Frictions of temples<br>- When you are done with working on the lower eyelid, move to the temple area. Work on your smile lines. Take a fold next to the corner of the eye and perform the friction massage of it. The skin in this area is less sensitive, so you can apply slightly more power for the friction massage.<br>- Work your way through the whole temple area by taking the next fold and moving closer to your hairline. You may need to make 3 to 5 folds in this area.<br><strong>4th step</strong>. Stretch the wrinkles on the temples<br>- Use both hands for this technique. Both index and middle fingers are working here. Place them on the temple next to the end of the eye, where the skin is less sensitive than on the eyelids, one hand from above over your head and the other from below. The fingertips must meet before you start with the action.<br>- Push into the bone and hold it for 5 seconds, then pull both hands apart from each other for about an inch (2-2,5 cm) stretching the underlying tissues.<br>- Place the hands closer&nbsp;to the hairline and perform the same stretching technique. You may need to do it up to 4 times before you reach the hairline. Repeat the action. Going over the hairline is OK, it is even appreciated.</p><p>Repeat steps 2,3 and 4 on the other side.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>! The skin of the eye area is very sensitive. If you experience some discomfort or skin redness, reduce the power considerably.<br>! If you notice, the wrinkles of the eye area would become more definite, skip steps 2 and 3. Try it next week with reduced power.</p><p><em>Keep calm, be patient. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f64f.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> <br>Good luck! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p>*The infraorbital margin is the lower margin of the eye socket.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Inspect them carefully little by little.</p><p>- In-depth exercise for your facial tissues of the middle and lower part of your face, which gives a tender effect;<br>- Best preparation of the middle and lower parts for the following special correction techniques.</p><p><strong>Caution:&nbsp;</strong>No oil needed for this technique. Your hands don&rsquo;t need to slide over your skin. If you perform this technique for the first time, do it half-heartedly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br><strong>1. Action</strong>. Cheekbones<br>- Use the base of your palms for this action. Place them on your cheekbones, thumbs facing your ears.<br>- Make rolling wave-like movements from the folds under your nose toward the temples. Repeat this action 5 to10 times.<br>- Place the base of the palms a bit higher, so that you would slightly touch the eye area during the movement. Repeat this action 5 to 10 times.<br><strong>2. &nbsp;Action</strong>. Cheeks<br>- For this action use the base of the thumb (also known as Venus mount). Place it at the corners of your mouth.<br>- Make rolling wave-like movements from the mouth toward your ears. Repeat it 5 to10 times.<br><strong>3. &nbsp;Action</strong>. Jaw<br>- Use the edges of your palms for this action. Place them close to your chin, fingers facing backward, the thumbs pointing down.<br>- Make rolling wave-like movements from chin toward the jaw angle. Repeat it 5 to10 times.<br>- Finish the exercise with the same movement placed a bit lower than the previous move.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>The technique is simple, so nothing to worry about here. Just be sure to do rolling movements, like a wave from the beginning to the end.<br>DO NOT slide with your palms over the skin. You don&rsquo;t want to hurt yourself.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Good luck!&nbsp;<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

So, please, don&rsquo;t overdo it! Otherwise, you can get a tissue inflammation. You know, they say &ldquo;Give a fool rope enough&hellip;&rdquo; <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f605.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>Work with your face delicately, please. Just imagine how a one-year-old baby would be touching, pushing, pinching your face with its maximum power. You should not do it harder than that.</p><p><strong>Benefits:</strong><br>- <strong>Full face</strong>, puffy tissues and visibly uneven skin: the friction technique reduces the fat deposits under your facial skin making it firm and smooth;<br>- <strong>Skinny face</strong>: frictions help to revitalize the fat cells of your stored fat reserve, providing the necessary nutrition to accelerate the metabolism, and as a result, your fat deposits under the skin will recover!</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- You need your both index fingers for this action. The first one is for fixing and should not be moved. The second one is the working finger and will perform the main action.<br>- Place your fixing finger on the center part of your cheek, so that the fingertip would point to the middle of your eye, and its beginning would rest in the middle of the jawline.<br>- Place your working finger in parallel to the fixing one near the nose (the middle joint of your finger would touch the alar wing of the nose).<br>- Move the working finger to the fixing one, folding your tissues. You should try to pick up as many tissues as you can. Your fold can be bigger or smaller than the one on the video. This is absolutely normal! We all have different fat deposits under the skin, different liquid levels, different qualities of soft-tissues.<br>- Start moving your working finger slightly up and down keeping the fold firmly. Little by little the tissues would escape from your fold as a result of your frictions. If it slips out too fast, return to the folding again. Don&lsquo;t do the frictions more than twice on the same spot.<br>- Move your fixing finger toward the ear with the distance of 1 to 2 times bigger than your finger. The working finger starts moving from the place where the previous fold has slipped out. Do the same foldings and frictions as previously. Then move the fixing finger again like you did before and repeat the frictions.<br>- You can do 3 to 4 foldings on each cheek. It is not necessary to do more than 4.</p><p>- Repeat the sequence on the other side of your face.</p><p>- There is another variation. If your fingers are tired you can straighten your palm and use it instead repeating the sequence&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong></p><p>! Frictions should be done on CLEAN skin only! If you put on some oil or creme, your skin is going to be SO slippery! You won&rsquo;t be able to hold your skin folded and work with it properly<br>Remember, in this case, &ldquo;harder&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;better&rdquo;. &nbsp;Please, don&rsquo;t squeeze the tissues between your fingers for dear life!&nbsp;</p><p>! <strong>Skinny face</strong>: If you get a tired look after the frictions - stop practicing it and let your skin recover. Then start doing it again with half of the power and once in 3 days.</p><p>DO NOT THINK IT IS NOT YOUR CASE! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60e.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>I have made this exact mistake... until my loved ones would start noticing it. Well, recovery took some time, but everything is good after all. Remember the one-year-old kid touch rule and resume practicing 1 to 2 times a week.</p><p><em>Take it easy!&nbsp;<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\"> <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"\"></a></p>",

Today you learn the first basic technique, so please pay special attention to these muscles.</p><p>At first, a little bit of the anatomy.<br><span class=\"fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable fr-active\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"true\"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/542173520\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"fr-draggable\"></iframe></span><br>These muscles have long scientific names:<br>1. The muscle that lifts the upper lip and nose wing is called Musculus levator labii superioris alaequae nasi in Latin. It runs along the nose. Contracted it lifts the upper lip and the tip of the nose. The muscle is attached to the upper frontal process of the maxilla (visibly under the lacrimal canals of the eyes) &nbsp;and inserts into the skin of the lateral part of the nostril and upper lip.(F1)<br>2. The muscle that lifts the upper lip (lat. Musculus levator labii superioris) starts at the infraorbital margin (the lower margin of the eye socket) above the infraorbital foramen (a small opening in the bone below) and inserts into the skin of the lateral part of the nostril and upper lip. (F2)<br>These both muscles are very important for facial expressions. They contract visibly when we smell something stinky and say &quot;Phi ..&quot;. Therefore, as it is somewhat cumbersome to use their full names and for the sake of simplicity, we will call the one that is closer to the nose - F1, and the one that is farther from the nose - F2.<br>The F1 and F2 are the upper lip lifting muscles.<br>By contracting, they lift the lip and also form the nasolabial fold and the bumps above it. In a contracted state, the nasolabial fold is always present on the face ... and becomes more distinguished, if you do not relax these F lifters muscles properly.</p><p>So, let&#39;s start relaxing the F lifters muscles. At the same time, you get an excellent lymphatic drainage of the nasal area, which has lots of benefits:<br>- The nasolabial folds start to shrink.<br>- The asymmetry of the nose and the lacrimal grooves is leveled off.<br>- The bruises, dark circles and puffiness under the eyes starts to diminish.<br>- The F muscles are relaxed and prepared for the more advanced techniques.</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> Remember the rule of a one-year-old child&rsquo;s strength. Do not hurt yourself. You should feel comfortable during the whole exercise. You can adjust the strength for this exercise yourself later.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- You need both index and middle fingers for this exercise. Place them on the nasolabial fold so that the middle fingers are in the corners of the nose wings. The index and middle fingers are pressed together.<br>- Press in the soft tissues slightly, hold it like this for 3 to 5 seconds, and then begin small-amplitude circular massage movements. Circular motions in this case are similar to digging: inward, to the nose, then upwards with pressure, then outwards releasing the pressure and finally down.<br>- After a few circular movements, the index finger will reach the orbital bone. As soon as you feel this, raise your index finger, you no longer need it for the massage. Continue massaging with your middle fingers only until they reach the lacrimal canAls of the eyes.<br>- Slide your middle fingers to the nose wings starting from the lacrimal canals. The fingers go straight down the The muscle that lifts the upper lip and nose wing (F1). Feel them stretching and relaxing.<br>- Repeat it one more time. 2 sets shouldn&rsquo;t take longer than a minute.<br>- When you are done with the exercise, smooth out the skin surface pressing it with your fingers and moving upwards from below. Try to &ldquo;place&rdquo; the skin the way you would like to have it. It shouldn&rsquo;t take more than 5 to10 seconds.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>The exercise is easy and comforting but don&rsquo;t get carried away too much the first time. Remember, in this business, regularity is more important than intensity. And the increased intensity in the early stages can lead to discomfort the next day, which may make you want to stop or take a break. And breaks during the study course are not really useful.</p><p><em>Good luck! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

With the second index finger, we press all soft tissue from the wing of the nose to the fixing one, forming a fold of tissues, while we think about the muscle and try to squeeze it. We hold the clamp for 20-30 seconds. (4 inhale-exhale rounds)</p><p>Step 2. <strong>Pressing</strong><br>We put both index fingers in the middle of F1 and sink them to the bone, hold the pressure for 5-10 seconds.</p><p>The task is to push the muscle in the middle, then stretching will follow.</p><p>In order not to be confused of the fact you could stretch the skin too much in step 3, you can push in, creating some additional skin fold for stretching beforehand.</p><p>Step 3. <strong>Stretching</strong><br>Without releasing the pressure, we stretch the F1 muscle towards its beginning and end very slowly. The upper finger slowly moves to the lacrimal canal, and the lower to the wing of the nose. Ideally, movement should last the same amount of time as compression. When the fingers have reached the end points, we continue to hold the pressure on them for another 5-10 seconds and release.</p><p>Step 4. <strong>Soothing the skin</strong><br>The top layers of the skin may look crumpled for a short time after such intense pressure and stretch marks. Let&#39;s help them find their rightful place as quickly as possible.</p><p>Using these light massage movements, you bring the skin back to the place where it is supposed to be. Pay attention to your sensations. After the first times you perform this massage, your muscle may ache a little, this is absolutely normal.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Good luck!<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

So, please do not touch the skin around the eyes, it is very delicate.</p><p><span class=\"fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"true\"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/542666094\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"fr-draggable\"></iframe></span><br></p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- You need your both hands for this exercise. Place the base of your palms on the temples so that you do not touch the eyelids, the fingers are pointing to the crown.<br>- You slightly pull in your palms into the temples for 3 to 5 seconds. Place your elbows on the table, the head fixed between your hands, and relax your neck.<br>- As soon as you relax your neck, the head will naturally slide down under its own weight. Adjust the pressure with your palms so that your head slides down VERY slowly. This motion is over when the fingers meet at the crown. The way is short, so take your time. The slower you let your head slide, the better is the effect. 30 to 40 seconds should be enough for this motion.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>Be sure not to stretch your skin around your eyes. You work with the muscles of the temporal region on the deep level, not with the skin. The skin will tighten all by itself as the soft tissues under the skin improve.</p><p>From my personal experience, I can say that this is the fastest way to refresh your face in almost any situation. It is very fast and effective, if you for example need to look fresher for a photo.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Take care of your pretty eyes! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f64f.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</em></p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Keep the circles small. 5-10 circles are enough for the first time. Listen to your sensations.<br>- Move the fixing thumb to the next position towards your ear, so that &ldquo;the hook&rdquo; move on to the new area without leaving out any area of your jawline untouched.

Fix the one &ldquo;hook&rdquo; firmly to your jawline, the other one grabs the jawline firmly and starts moving towards the ear. The thumb under the chin is leading the action. It follows the jawline till the very end of it. It should pass the jaw angle and finish the action by touching the ear.<br>- When you spot a bump or any other unevenness, make a break from the exercise for a moment and give it a bit of a massage with your fingertips, then continue the smoothing action.<br>- 5 to 10 times are enough. Listen to your sensations, please. They normally give you the feeling of how many times are enough for you.</p><p>- Repeat the sequence on the other side.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>The smoothing action should be performed with a <strong>strong grab</strong> of your jawline, <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f4aa.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60e.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; quite seldom I use this word.

Normally we do not waste any thoughts on it. We just accept the fact that the face is swelling as years pass. In fact, the main reason for this is a clogged lymphatic system which makes our skin look thicker. We normally put up with it until it gets too heavy and starts pulling parts of a face down, bringing such unpleasant effects like loose skin, puffy lower eyelid and nasolabial folds.<br>Most of the lymph fluid from the face region goes through the lymph nodes in the neck area. If&nbsp;the lymph transport system doesn&rsquo;t work properly, it results in a clogged lymphatic system in the neck area. The more lymph is stagnating there, the more symptoms like uneven jawline, double chin, neck lines, fibrosis and lymphedema.<br>We are not going to dwell on the reasons for lymphedema, they are very complex and there are too many of them. Our goal is to make the lymph transport system work better in order to get rid of the unhealthy volume.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br><strong>1. Action</strong>. Warm-up with large pinches<br>All in all about 1 minute.<br>- You need both hands for this exercise. Use your thumbs and the index fingers formed to hooks. Pinch the area below the jaw. Try to grab as much soft tissues as possible when you do the pinches.<br>- Work your way through the area of your neck from the chin to Adam&#39;s apple. You can even go further down under the Adam&#39;s apple, if you feel like doing it.<br><strong>2. Action</strong>. Squeeze out excess of fluids<br>All in all about 1 minute for the both sides.<br>- Use the same thumbs and &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; but this time you work single-handed. On the right side you work with your right hand, on the left side with your left hand.<br>- Start working from the middle of the area under your chin. Take the thumb from the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; apart as much as possible. Place the thumb under the jaw angle, the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; should be under the chin. The thumb is for fixing and the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; is our working finger here. Squeeze out the soft tissues towards the thumb letting the flesh slip out from the pinch.<br>- As soon as the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; reaches the thumb, place the thumb closer to the ear and repeat the squeezing action. You may need to do up to 3 steps before you reach the ear.<br>- After that, place both the thumb and the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; further down along your neck and repeat the squeezing technique. Work your way through the whole area you warmed up in action 1.</p><p>Repeat the 2nd action on the other side.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>As always in this business, it is better to do it gently rather than zealously.<br>Especially when you do it for the first time. Later, you will figure out the correct amount of power you can apply.</p><p><em>Have fun! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p>*Lymphedema is chronic tissue swelling that happens when the lymphatic transport capacity is exceeded.<br>**Tissue fibrosis is the phenomenon in which a tissue has a progressive deposition of collagen fibers with age. Tissue fibrosis is associated with aging of most of our organs, and it is the main pathology in arteriosclerosis, chronic bronchitis/emphysema, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The causes and characteristics of fibrosis are analyzed with misrepair mechanism, a mechanism proposed in misrepair-accumulation aging theory.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

We chew and smile many times a day, and when we&rsquo;re nervous or angry, we grit our teeth. With age, this residual spasm leads to shortening and thickening of the chewing muscles. When we are young, these muscles lie flat from the cheekbones to the lower jaw... Because of the spasm, the muscles gather in one dense bump, pull the corner of the lower jaw upward, disrupting the performance of the mandibular joint, change the angle of inclination of the lower jaw, and the tissues of the cheeks are sagging down and displacing to the center.<br>Relaxing the chewing muscles helps to:<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; restore a clear oval of the face.<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; reduce or completely get rid of defects in the middle part of the face, such as: nasolabial folds, flabby sagging cheeks.<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; get rid of the habit of clenching teeth, due to which teeth will wear out less, prevention of bruxism.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>Massaging the chewing muscles can be painful both during execution and for a while after. This is normal and will go away with continued practice. You can relieve discomfort with a dry warm compress on the area of the chewing muscles.</p><p><strong>Technique:</strong><br><strong>1 step</strong>. Warm up.<br>Start the massage by warming up the chewing muscles.<br>Perform it with the upper part of the palm (metacarpophalangeal joints, see picture below), with the pads at the base of the fingers. Open your mouth, relax the lower jaw and knead the large chewing muscles in circular movements from the center to the periphery for 30 seconds. You can also do warm up with fingertips as we did in basic course.</p><p><span class=\"fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"true\"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/576367915\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"fr-draggable\"></iframe></span><br></p><p><strong>2 step</strong>. Stretching the Superficial and Deep Masseter muscles.<br>The pads in the upper part of the palm (metacarpophalangeal joints) will be the working ones.<br>Put you palms on the cheeks so that proximal interphalangeal joints rest on the cheekbones. Pull soft tissues up to reach the cheeckbone with the working pads, press them in and relax the lower jaw slightly opening the mouth. Now slowly pull the pressed the Superficial and Deep Masseter muscles down in 5 seconds. Without letting the skin off return the working pads to the starting position.

The goal is to achieve an adhesion of tissues and shift the tissues of the forehead upwards.<br>- Provide the relaxation of the neck and the pressure on the tissues. Pause for 20 seconds.<br>- Straighten up fingers of connected palms, allow the head to fall under its own weight compensating the pressure by your hands. After that, let the head slide slowly downwards over the base of your palms.<br>- Keep your neck as relaxed as possible without losing the pressure on the tissues.<br>- Do not force the sliding to make it faster. The slower it goes the better effect you get.</p><p>Stop sliding when the base of your palms reaches the line of the hair grow.</p><p>Place your forehead on the starting position and repeat sliding without pause twice.</p><p><strong>Set 2</strong><br>Do the same exercise but with the palms moved left so that the right palm will be placed above the left eyebrow.</p><p>The first sliding with a 20 seconds pause, the second and the third without.</p><p><strong>Set 3</strong><br>Do the same exercise with the palms moved to the right so that the left palm will be placed above your right eyebrow.

                        "exerciseDescription": "<p><strong>Vacuum massage for forehead&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Renewed skin with only the power of a small silicone cup!<br>The vacuum massage (VM) affects the secretion of collagen and elastin:<br>- skin gets rid of toxins and looks fresher;<br>- bags and dark circles under eyes disappear;<br>- pores shrink;<br>- wrinkles get smoothed.</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> Do not overdo it. After a vacuum massage (VM), the face should blush a little - this is called hyperemia. This is what we are trying to achieve. Light hyperemia will disappear within half a day, in a day at the very latest. However, if you &quot;work too hard&quot;, it may stay for several days. Be careful, this is your face after all!</p><p>There are contraindications to a vacuum massage:<br>- acute diseases and flare-up of chronic conditions;<br>- skin defects;<br>- thrombophlebitis (vein inflammation);<br>- increased fragility and vascular permeability (disrupted blood supply to soft tissues);<br>- severe cardiovascular disease (severe disease involving heart or blood vessels);<br>- mental disorders;<br>- age over 80.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- You need oil to perform this massage technique (see the oil guide). Use a silicon cup with a diameter of about 1 inch (2.5-3 cm). Put a few drops on your palms, rub them, and place your palms on your face. Also add some oil on the cup&#39;s working surface directly for better gliding. ⠀<br>- No need to create a strong vacuum!<br><strong>1. Action</strong> - suction.<br>- Create a vacuum with a cup by grabbing the cup between your thumb and index finger and squeezing it. Press it to your skin and then let it go. This would create a vacuum that sticks the cup to your face by picking up the skin underneath.<br>-Leave the cup sticking to your skin for 5 to 10 seconds.<br>- Repeat this action several times on different parts of your forehead.<br><strong>2. Action</strong> - circular movements.<br>- Press the squeezed cup to your skin creating the vacuum. The cup should be able to move without losing the vacuum &ndash; this is exactly what you need. 2 to 3 circular movements on one spot, then you can move on to the next part of your forehead and repeat the action.<br><strong>3. Action</strong> - horizontal movements.<br>- Press the squeezed cup to your skin creating the vacuum and drag the cup horizontally across your forehead. If the cup has lost the vacuum, create the vacuum and continue from the same place. Vertical movements are also possible.</p><p>- The time you spend on every area is very individual and depends on the sensitivity of your skin, on how much vacuum you created and so on. Perform the massage until your skin is slightly red. No more and no less.</p><p><strong>Important !⠀</strong><br>Make sure to wash off the oil or other massage product afterwards! Don&#39;t leave it on your skin.<br>During the vacuum massage, the skin releases many substances that will not have a beneficial effect on it! These substances must be removed from the skin, otherwise it can result in irritation, redness or skin peeling off.<br>Make sure that the vacuum you create is minimal!<br>Do not try to pull too much skin into the cup.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Be gentle with yourself,</em><br><em>Good luck! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p>Move on to the VM for middle face.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

                        "exerciseDescription": "<p><strong>Laying on the roller</strong></p><p>Unique, easy, relaxing and super effective exercise to release spasms in your spine inner muscles and improve neck static. &nbsp;Look at the picture, look at the muscles supporting the spine from outside and inside (long muscle of the neck, lat. &quot;longus colli&quot;) of the spine bone, they connect vertebrae one to others. What? Do you think happens, when they get into spasmodic state? They cement the curves of the spine that actually we need to straighten for the sake of better wellbeing and rejuvenation.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>We can&#39;t reach the anterior surface of the spine with hands to massage them. These inner muscles can be relaxed only by prolonged stretching, not shorter than 5 minutes. Even in yoga, you will not find the poses that can help their relaxation effectively. Only laying on the rolls can really help in relaxing inner spine muscles to improve the situation around 7th cervical vertebra, which normally sticks out with ageing.&nbsp;</p><p>Technique is simple, but there are precautions:<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is not for pregnant<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; Coming out of this exercise should be VERY slow and delicate because you stretch your spine, so fast jump out from the pose can cause lumbago.<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; You may &nbsp;fall asleep in this pose. This is OK. Just come out of it even slower.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>1. Make roll from a bath towel. Fold it twice along its length, roll and tie it up with a ribbon. You can adjust thickness and hardness of the roll according to your need by softening or tightening the ribbon. For the beginning, start with loosen ribbon.</p><p>2. Prepare the place on the flat solid surface like a floor, make sure that you get no wind over there. Use yoga mat or a rag to lay on.</p><p><strong>1 action.</strong> Under the lower back. 5-10 minutes.<br>Sit with the crossed legs, place the roll under the lower back perpendicular to it. Lay down on the mat, straiten your legs and relax. Heels are at the same width as your shoulders, arms stretched out over your head. Relax and breathe evenly. Relax in this pose for 5-10 minutes.<br>To make the stretching deeper, connect your big toes, keeping the heels on the same spots, and put your palms on the floor over your head with elbows pointing upwards.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT.</strong> Coming out of the pose is very slow. First, turn your body on the side and pull out the roll from the lower back. If you finished the exercise, slowly get onto your hands and knees and do simple bands of the spine, then slowly get up on the feet.</p><p><strong>2 action.</strong> Under the middle of the back. 5-10 minutes.</p><p>From the previous action pose turn on your side and adjust the roll higher, to the middle of the back, again perpendicular to the spine, and again lay on it and relax. &nbsp;For deeper stretching, do the same toes connection and palms set on floor. Relax for 5-10 minutes.<br><strong>IMPORTANT.</strong> Coming out of the pose is very slow.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3 action</strong>. Under the shoulder blades perpendicular. 5-10 minutes.</p><p>From the previous action pose turn on your side and adjust the roll higher, under the shoulder blades, again perpendicular to the spine, and again lay on it and relax. &nbsp;For deeper stretching, do the same toes connection and palms set on floor. Relax for 5-10 minutes.<br><strong>IMPORTANT.</strong> Coming out of the pose is very slow.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4 action.</strong> Between the shoulder blades, along the spine. 5-10 minutes.</p><p>From the previous action pose turn on your side and change orientation of the roll, this time set it along the spine, between your shoulder blades. One end of the roll should be at the 7th cervical vertebra area, so that the cervical vertebrae and head would be lower than the rest of the spine resting on the roll. Relax on the roll. &nbsp;</p><p>For deeper stretching relaxation of the inner spine muscles, do few swings of arms in opposite directions. One arm along the body, the other is stretched straight over your head, change their positions. Try to do 10 swings like this, then relax for 5-10 minutes. Do the same toes connection and palms set on floor for deeper stretching if you fell like it.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT.</strong> Coming out of the pose is very slow. First, turn your body on the side. Slowly get on all fours and do simple backbends, then slowly get to your feet.</p><p>Relaxation on the roll should be very deep, you may get sleepy easily. Do not let yourself fall asleep, especially when you just start practising this technique.</p><p><strong>Feeling sleepy?</strong> Make a couple of deep breaths and turn on your side, remove the roll from under your body and enjoy pleasant relaxation in your back. Always keep in mind that you have relaxed your spine very well, vertebrae got to forgotten positions and got stretched out from each other a bit, restructuring to the healthier spine state. This healthy state of spine got forgotten by the tissues surrounding your vertebrae. If you return very fast to the regular vertical position, some little tissues may get clamped by vertebrae just a bit. This bit can cause a giant pain, so be careful when you get up. When you do it slowly, with awareness, all the tissues will find their righteous places, and you will feel just great!</p><p><br></p><p>Love your spine and live long happy life! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

The main movement is more of a sliding.

Perform the exercise either on moist skin or ideally after applying a day cream or tonic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- You will need your both hands for this technique. Place the inner edge of your palms on the sides of your nose. The knuckles of your index fingers should be placed at the corners of your lips. The thumbs should meet under the chin area. Press the muscle under your chin with your thumbs before you start the motion.<br>- Slightly slide over your face with the inner edges of the palms towards the ears.<br>- When you reach your ears with the index fingers, run the fingers from the ears down the neck to the collarbones. After you reach the collarbones, on the exhalation, press in your fingers under the collarbone for 1 to 2 seconds.<br>- Repeat the exercise 2 to 3 times. You can perform the exercise up to 5 times, if you feel like it.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>You are probably asking yourself: Will I not stretch my skin too much?... <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f631.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>Don&rsquo;t worry, your skin will not stretch too much!<br>Do not forget about moisturizing and smoothing your face, and you will never have to ask yourself this question during the practice again.</p><p>If you have a full face, and you feel like it, repeat the exercise in the evening.<br>Observe the reaction of your face, and listen to your sensations.</p><p>Check out the 2nd video to see what your lymphatic system of the head and neck look like. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f44c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Good luck!&nbsp;</em><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Jumping can be replaced by running in place.<br>The best time for this exercise is in the morning when you just woke up and still did not even have a glass of water or so.</p><p>What does this jump-the-lymph-exercise give us?<br>- Lymphatic system receives support in cleansing from cell waste;<br>- The body is mobilized, the metabolism is accelerated;<br>- It is the number-one-treatment for skin laxity;<br>- Cellulite is reduced;<br>- Excess fluid is slowly removed, which results in reduction of edemas and all the edematous congestion.</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> The course is designed for conventionally healthy people. If you have any chronic medical conditions or have recently had a surgery, please do not jump.<br>Pregnant women should also not jump.</p><p>Ladies, hold your breast while jumping.<br>If you are overweight, you should start with easy jumping, which means a low jumping height and a lower number of jumps. You can increase the height and the number, when you feel like it.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- Find a free space with a solid floor.<br>- Go on your tiptoes and let your body weight fall naturally on your heels. Continue these jumps, gradually increasing the jumping height and the speed.<br>- Do about 30 to 40 jumps the first time. You can gradually increase the number of jumps up to 100 on the following days of practice.</p><p><strong>Important!</strong><br>Do not lift your toes off the floor, it is not necessary to bounce, but to hit the floor with your heels. The floor still can shake. Be sure to choose a solid floor. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have swelling in your entire body, you can repeat this jumping exercise in the afternoon and in the evening, but not later than 1 hour before going to bed.

It is a basic exercise that you need to have always at your disposal.&nbsp;</p><p>This exercise:</p><p>- improves your neck zone (cervical spine) functional mobility;</p><p>- warms up your neck muscles;</p><p>- dissolves possible congestion in the cervical zone;</p><p>- restores the physiological tone of the neck muscles back to normal;</p><p>- corrects the neck static;</p><p>- prevents osteochondrosis and arthritis in the neck area.</p><p><strong>Caution:&nbsp;</strong>You can practice it any time of the day in any convenient situation. Do it before you start with other neck exercises and also after it. But start by doing it very very gently.</p><p>If you are doing it for the first time in your life, you may be surprised by cracking sounds and possible sudden aches.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The technique:</strong></p><ul><li>Don&rsquo;t forget to control your breathing while doing any exercise. Deep inhale and then long exhale without pauses.</li><li>Stand up straight, let your arms hang down relaxed, and reach upwards with the top of your head and relax.&nbsp;</li><li>Let&rsquo;s call it the crown of your head. It is also a nice to imagine that you have something very important on your head <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f607.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> .</li><li>Then slowly drop your head as if you would try to touch your chest with the chin while exhaling.&nbsp;</li><li>Start to move your crown to the left and upwards doing semicircle while inhaling until your head gets to the position when the back of it looks down and you look up.</li><li>Continue the rotation from this position while exhaling by pointing your crown to the right then drop your chin down again. Imagine the crown drawing circles over your head.&nbsp;</li><li>Continue rotations to the right and do it 4 more times. Do not speed up! Keep doing it gently even if you feel alright after the first circle.</li><li>Do the same rotations to the left side. 5 times.&nbsp;</li><li>Keep doing it slowly and gently.</li><li>The larger circles you can draw with your crown, the more flexible and prepared for further exercises your neck is.</li></ul><p><strong>Attention!&nbsp;</strong>The technique is simple but please pay much attention to what you feel while doing the exercise. Any sharp pain can be a signal to cervical spine osteochondrosis. In that case you have to be very careful and attentive to your neck area. Any other exercise for your neck should be done very gently.&nbsp;</p><p>Do not ask me to diagnose what can be wrong with your neck, I am not a doctor. Besides, in that case, you need to see a doctor in person to get the correct diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Tale:&nbsp;</strong>PLEASE DO NOT THINK THIS IT IS NOT YOUR CASE!&nbsp;</p><p>I made this mistake when I did this neck exercise for the first time at the age of 40, 8 years after my last yoga class. I thought I was still flexible enough and stretching my neck would be an easy task.</p><p>It WAS! &nbsp;Very easy... <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f62d.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; BUT I ended up with a lumbago in my neck area which kept me from doing any other neck exercises for the next half a year. I had to downgrade it and go through a rehabilitation course to return mobility, strength and healthy feeling in the neck. This course is now called &quot;Take it easy&quot;, it consists of 20 easy exercises aimed at returning the mobility to your spine, and you can find this amazing course in the app.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Extra:&nbsp;</strong>Head rotations can be done in a sitting position, too. The standing position is more<em>&nbsp;</em>preferred just because all the following neck exercises are done from a standing position.</p><p><em>Good luck!</em> <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Have you tried?</strong></p><p>I bet you have heard many interesting sounds by now! :)) &nbsp;Clicks, crunching and even cracks are kind of normal... They are even normally expected.</p><p>I have been doing this exercise every day for past 4 years. My neck still does some clicking and crunching from time to time, but a lot less than before and I am no longer having any concerns about getting a lumbago.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Got sudden pain? Do not hesitate to consult your doctor!</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Sides</strong></p><p>Basics, basics for every day!<br>Exercise on the sides of your neck.</p><p>- Your neck gets long and strong;</p><p>- The side muscles of your neck are relaxed and better supplied with blood;</p><p>- Tension in your shoulders is reduced;</p><p>- Your head&rsquo;s supply with blood also improves, which results in a relief of headaches and shoulder pain.</p><p><strong>Caution:&nbsp;</strong>If you do it correctly, you will feel comfortable at any time while exercising.<br>Slow and gentle movements are the key to a healthy neck in this exercise.<br>The word &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; here means a slight pressure against the main movement.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong></p><p><strong>1 Action</strong>. Hump</p><p>- Stand in the upright position, stretch your crown upwards, relax your shoulders and arms.</p><p>- Put your right hand on your waist so that your arm and a bodyside would make a triangle. Now stretch the long side of this triangle by lifting the right shoulder as high as possible. Your trapezoid muscle should make a hump.</p><p>- Use this hump as base for your neck and your head, tilt your head slowly toward the uplifted shoulder. Your neck must firmly meet with the hump that you created with your trapezoid muscle, the ear may not necessarily touch the shoulder - it is not what we are aiming for. The goal is to get a slight pressure of the contracted trapezoids on the right side of your neck.</p><p>- Control your breathing. Breathe smoothly. Try to make your breathing in and out equally long.&nbsp;</p><p>- Keep this position for 4 deep inhale-exhale rounds; Return your head to the upright position and let your strained arm relax, spot the difference in sensations to the opposite side.</p><p><strong>2 Action</strong>. Stretching</p><p>- Keep your head in the upright position. Put your left hand over the head as if you were trying to grab your right ear. Let your left palm rest on the right side of your head.</p><p>- Tilt your head slowly to the left &ndash; the opposite side of where you made a hump previously. The hump and the neck are getting stretched now.</p><p>- The hand rests on your head without any tension, keep it relaxed. The hand performs slight pressure using its own weight only. Do not push!</p><p>- Relax the shoulder of the arm that rests on your head.</p><p>- Control your breathing. Breathe smoothly. Try to inhale and exhale equally long.&nbsp;</p><p>- Keep this position for the next 4 deep inhale-exhale rounds.</p><p><strong>3. Action</strong>. Compensation</p><p>- Return the head slowly in the upright position. The hand now is compensating the return action of the head, keeping the neck in the stretched state. Let the palm be in the same place until the very end of the action.</p><p>When your head is straight up with your hand compensating it with a slight pressure, keep this compensating pressure for the next 2 rounds of breathing in and out. Both the head and the hand &laquo;want&raquo; to keep the head in the perfectly upright position.</p><p>Start slowly with the stretching action again. Stay in the stretched position for 2 inhale and exhale rounds. Return your head to the upright position with the compensating pressure by your hand.</p><p>Now let your hand down. Relax. Close your eyes for 5 seconds and spot the difference between the left and the right side.</p><p>Repeat the sequence for the other side of your body.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong></p><p>As with all neck exercises, perform it very slowly&nbsp;and be attentive to your sensations. If you do it right and keep your neck as long as possible in every position, you are not going to experience any discomfort.</p><p>! DO NOT try to reach shoulders with your ears.

                "exerciseDescription": "<p><strong>Neck complex of exercises. 4. Trapezius</strong><br>Stretching the trapezius muscles.</p><p>- Your head posture improves;</p><p>- The neck gets longer and stronger;</p><p>- Tension in shoulders is released;</p><p>- Your head&rsquo;s supply with blood also improves;</p><p>- The better feeling in the body as a whole. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> Please perform this exercise slowly and gently. Remember, be especially careful if you never trained your neck muscles, we don&rsquo;t want to risk a lumbago. If you do the technique correctly, the neck will only get stronger and longer.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong></p><p><strong>1. Action</strong>. Rest on the hump</p><p>- Stand up in the upright position with a hand on your waist, your thumb looking down and your middle finger pointing to the spine bone. Your palm is resting on the part of your body where you suppose your kidney. Move your elbow backwards. Your arm and the bodyside would make a triangle. Now stretch the long side of this triangle by lifting your shoulder as high as possible. Your trapezius muscles should make a hump. This hump will be the base for the back of your head. Now turn your head in the opposite direction to the hump and look upwards. The back of your head should comfortably rest on the hump. No extra tension here.<br>- Stay in this position for 4 inhale-exhale rounds. Breathe evenly.</p><p><strong>2. Action</strong>. Stretching</p><p>- Return your head to the upright position and let your strained arm relax.<br>- With the other hand, take the back of your head, so that your wrist lies on the top of the head and fingers are pointing down. Ideally, the elbow would look outstretched. The hand here controls the following stretching.<br>- Tilt your head towards the chest, then move it slowly to the armpit of your controlling arm. Stretch your chin towards the armpit. Stay in this position for 4 inhale-exhale rounds. Breathe evenly, feel the muscles being stretched, starting from your skull and ending in your shoulder.</p><p><strong>3. Action</strong>. Compensation</p><p>- Return your head to the upright position by going the same way back. The controlling hand compensates the movement, which has the effect of slowing down the return movement with its natural weight.<br>- Stay in the upright position for the next 2 inhale-exhale rounds. The controlling hand is fixing the head and doesn&rsquo;t let it go backwards. Yet the all-up tension would be pointed up.</p><p>Repeat the stretching and fixing sequence and hold it for 2 inhale-exhale rounds each.&nbsp;</p><p>Repeat the sequence for the other side of your body.</p><p>It is the last exercise of the neck complex. It is advisable to do the <strong>head rotations after</strong> it.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong></p><p>The controlling hand is for control only. Do not push while stretching. Its own weight is just enough pressure. If you think your hand might be too heavy, do not let all of its weight lay on your head. Listen to your body and try to find the right pressure.</p><p>Do the neck complex of exercises every day, and soon you will be amazed at how much longer your neck would become.<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f642.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>Take care! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

It is a static exercise, looks easy, but you must try yourself before you can judge. Performing it for the first time, try to do it for a minute, then you can gradually increase the duration, ideally up to 10 minutes a day.</p><p>Benefits:<br>- Neck posture is improved.<br>- The neck gets long and strong.<br>- You will find the real straight posture for your spine.<br>- Oxygen consumption increases as your lungs can intake more air in this pose.<br>- Nerve system is strengthened.</p><p><strong>Caution:&nbsp;</strong>This exercise is not suitable for pregnant women.<br>You may feel dizzy, you may experience trembling in your calves and arms.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- Find a clean wall, ideally without a baseboard, so that your heels can touch the same surface that your head will lean on. There should be enough space over your head, so you can move upwards freely.</p><p>- Stand against the wall with your back to the wall. Your heels, calves, buttocks, back shoulder blades should be touching the wall.</p><p>- Straighten up your neck and point your &laquo;crown&raquo; upwards, lean the back of your head on the wall and look straightforward. You can close your eyes during the exercise, if you feel like it.</p><p>- Relax. Let all your muscles release the tension, only some muscles in the back are compensating this relaxation and keep your spine straight against the wall.</p><p>- While relaxing, keep your calves, back shoulder blades and the back of the head well attached to the wall. Correct the position, if they are not.</p><p>- Flatten your body gradually against the wall while keeping it relaxed. Your arms should be hanging relaxed.</p><p>If you are the one to go for 10 minutes every day - you are probably the king of posture! After a month of practice, you should check your height, don&rsquo;t be surprised, if you get half an inch taller.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>If you are overweight then getting your heels, calves and buttocks to touch the same surface would be difficult. In this case, step away from the wall just a bit, but surely keep your buttocks, back shoulder blades, and the back of the head to the surface.<br>You can get some strange sensations across your body, which are normally expected for beginners. It could be trembling, itching, a slight numbing in your legs and arms. It will gradually subside every day. One day you will find yourself resting in this pose, I promise.&nbsp;<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like a new person every time after this exercise.

Our body structures grow together, forming connective tissues in the wrong place or in excess of its healthy amount.</p><p>This process is also called <strong>tissue fibrosis</strong>.</p><p>Exactly the same process can occur with the GA. Our goal is to restore the mobility to the GA so that the tissues can return to their right place. When the GA is not flexible enough, the skin formed to folds and wrinkles on the neck and face wouldn&rsquo;t return to its original position... So, please take this exercise very seriously!</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- At first, we make an easy test. Press any place on your scalp with your index finger (frontal part where your hair starts to grow, crown, nape, or the most stubborn place behind the ears) and try to move the skin crosswise (right, left, forward, backward).<br>Does it move in all directions? How much does it shift? Does it shift at all the places?<br>Ideally, the shift should be about half an inch in each direction. The GA massage will bring you to these great results.</p><p>- The technique is simple and variable; you can take this massage creatively. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; Our goal is to return mobility.<br>- You can use all your fingers, 8 or 10 as you wish. Place them on your scalp at any convenient place to start with and press the skin with your fingers to the skull. Start with crosswise movements&nbsp;(right, left, forward, backward). 2 to 3 will be enough, then you can move further to the nearby area about 1 inch further.<br>- Perform this technique all over the skull, all the hairy part of your head (including the parts where the hair growth has decreased).<br>- If you come across the parts that are completely resistant to a crosswise shift, you can try other massage movements: circular, shift to one side, pushing. There is room for creativity. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f44d.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>- Harming yourself with this technique is virtually impossible, but the benefits from this exercise would grow in progression to your efforts.<br>- Ideally, the skin on the scalp should move along with the fingers. If your fingers slide a little through the hair, nothing wrong with it, it&rsquo;s even useful for stimulating the hair growth. With GA massage, the blood supply to the hair follicles is significantly improved, the hair becomes stronger and grows faster.</p><p><strong>Common question:</strong><br>Can this massage make my hair fall out? I treat them with care ... <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f636.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>Answer: The weak hair that you would lose anyway soon, may fall out. But it is a good thing, because new, healthier hair will grow there, if you keep doing the GA massage every day. The hair follicles are provided with a better nutrition, so that your hair would recover and grow fast. We have been seeing many happy followers whose hair growth has been restored. Take a look at our model, he is 45 years old, he has been practicing the GA massage (in different variations) since the age of 18, his hair is still thick as in his young years.</p><p>Practice well and enjoy!<br><em>Good luck!&nbsp;</em><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

The muscle is contracted when you are concentrating for a long time, or when you are making a serious face. It helps you to look more serious but leaves unwanted lines right in the middle of your face. Now it&rsquo;s time to relax it and smooth the marks the life left on your face.<br>- It is a great and also easy technique to bring the procerus muscle back in its original shape.<br>- Nose bridge lines are getting smoothed.<br>- Frown lines are smoothed too.<br>- Habit to frown is reduced.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br><strong>1st step</strong>. Press into the muscles<br>- Use your both index fingers for this technique. Place your fingertips side by side on the bridge of the nose and press them into the muscle to the bone. Press hard, in this exercise you are allowed do so. Feel the pressure and hold it for 10 seconds.<br>- Slowly pull the fingertips apart until the eyebrows.<br>- Repeat the motion 3 to 5 times.<br><strong>2nd step</strong>. Roll out<br>- Place your index fingers horizontally one over another. The hand of the upper finger would point up, and the one of the lower finger would point down. Place the fingers on the nose bridge with some pressure.<br>- Roll the fingers so that the hands would change the position from pointing up to pointing down and vice versa.<br>- After the rolling movement is finished, stretch this area by pulling the fingers apart a little.<br>- You can repeat the 2nd step 2 to 3 times.</p><p>All in all, it wouldn&rsquo;t take more than one minute.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>For this exercise you won&rsquo;t&nbsp;need any oils.

In this exercise, you learn how to work with your fingers deep and slow. When we say &quot;slow,&quot; it really means slow, about one millimetre in 5 seconds.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- Place your elbows on a table. Let the weight of your head lean the hooks. The back of your neck should be relaxed.<br>- Form your index fingers to &ldquo;hooks&rdquo;. Place both fingers on the nose bridge and push deep down to the bone. Feel the tissues for 10 to 20 seconds.<br>- One &ldquo;hook&rdquo; is the fixing one, you don&#39;t move it. The other one is the working one, you do move it, but very slowly, from the middle of your forehead towards the middle of your eyebrow.<br>- Return the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; to the start position. Repeat the action for the other side.<br>- Place the &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; a bit higher than your nose bridge. Now you can put them side by side with the finger joints touching each other. Push them in to the bone and keep them like this for 10 to 20 seconds. Compare your sensations to the previous position.<br>- Repeat the same slow movements using your working &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; for about 1 inch (2.5 centimetres)<br>- Place your &ldquo;finger hooks&rdquo; further up again. You may need to do it several times before you reach the hairline. Repeat the action.<br>- Going over the hairline is OK, it is even appreciated.<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f44d.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Attention!&nbsp;</strong><br>The movements of the working finger should be deep and slow, but not too long. The fixing finger should not drop the pressure while the working finger is moving.</p><p>How did it go?

Start with massaging pinching-like movements with light friction, moving along the superciliary arch* from your nose bridge to the middle of the eyebrow.<br><strong>2&nbsp;</strong>Action. <strong>Stretching</strong><br>- Make the same fold starting from the nose bridge. Start stretching the eyebrow muscle. The one hand is the fixing one, the other one is the pulling one. Pull the soft tissues along the fold towards the end of the eyebrow. The fold is thought to be about half inch long (1,5 cm). Place the fixing hand further to the end of your eyebrow and make another fold. You may need to do up to 3 folds one after another before you reach the middle of the eyebrow. Perform the pulling technique on every fold.</p><p>Repeat the sequence on the other side.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>Do not overdo it, please.

It can easily get harmed. Please remember in this exercise about the one-year-old baby power rule. Working on the eye area, imagine how gently a baby would touch the face, use the same power.</p><p>Check out what muscle you will work on</p><p><span class=\"fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"true\"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/543693547\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"fr-draggable\"></iframe></span><br></p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br><strong>1st step</strong>. Warm-up<br>- Use all your fingertips for this warm-up technique. Perform a massage on the whole lower eyelid area, slightly pressing in the infraorbital margin* bones. 30 seconds would be enough for the warm-up.<br><strong>2nd step</strong>. Frictions of lower eyelid<br>- Use your both index fingers. Make a little vertical fold of the soft tissues of the lid-cheek junction. You can grab about half an inch (1-1,5 cm) of soft tissues of the lower eyelid and below it, but please, do not squeeze it!<br>- Perform the massage on the fold, doing frictions very patiently and carefully. Take your time.<br>- When the fold slips out during the friction, make another fold in the next area, moving towards the end of the eye socket. Perform the same friction technique patiently. Work your way through the whole area. You can make up to 10 folds on each side, if you want to work the whole way through the eye area thoroughly and patiently. It is up to you. Listen to your sensations and the way your soft tissues respond, but do not overdo it.<br><strong>3d step</strong>. Frictions of temples<br>- When you are done with working on the lower eyelid, move to the temple area. Work on your smile lines. Take a fold next to the corner of the eye and perform the friction massage of it. The skin in this area is less sensitive, so you can apply slightly more power for the friction massage.<br>- Work your way through the whole temple area by taking the next fold and moving closer to your hairline. You may need to make 3 to 5 folds in this area.<br><strong>4th step</strong>. Stretch the wrinkles on the temples<br>- Use both hands for this technique. Both index and middle fingers are working here. Place them on the temple next to the end of the eye, where the skin is less sensitive than on the eyelids, one hand from above over your head and the other from below. The fingertips must meet before you start with the action.<br>- Push into the bone and hold it for 5 seconds, then pull both hands apart from each other for about an inch (2-2,5 cm) stretching the underlying tissues.<br>- Place the hands closer&nbsp;to the hairline and perform the same stretching technique. You may need to do it up to 4 times before you reach the hairline. Repeat the action. Going over the hairline is OK, it is even appreciated.</p><p>Repeat steps 2,3 and 4 on the other side.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>! The skin of the eye area is very sensitive. If you experience some discomfort or skin redness, reduce the power considerably.<br>! If you notice, the wrinkles of the eye area would become more definite, skip steps 2 and 3. Try it next week with reduced power.</p><p><em>Keep calm, be patient. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f64f.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> <br>Good luck! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p>*The infraorbital margin is the lower margin of the eye socket.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Place them close to your chin, fingers facing backward, the thumbs pointing down.<br>- Make rolling wave-like movements from chin toward the jaw angle. Repeat it 5 to10 times.<br>- Finish the exercise with the same movement placed a bit lower than the previous move.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>The technique is simple, so nothing to worry about here. Just be sure to do rolling movements, like a wave from the beginning to the end.<br>DO NOT slide with your palms over the skin.

                "exerciseDescription": "<p><strong>Frictions on middle part of the face</strong></p><p>That is a great exercise!<br>Very soon you&rsquo;ll feel how effectively this exercise works on the facial tissues. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Caution:&nbsp;</strong>This technique is very intensive. So, please, don&rsquo;t overdo it! Otherwise, you can get a tissue inflammation. You know, they say &ldquo;Give a fool rope enough&hellip;&rdquo; <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f605.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>Work with your face delicately, please. Just imagine how a one-year-old baby would be touching, pushing, pinching your face with its maximum power. You should not do it harder than that.</p><p><strong>Benefits:</strong><br>- <strong>Full face</strong>, puffy tissues and visibly uneven skin: the friction technique reduces the fat deposits under your facial skin making it firm and smooth;<br>- <strong>Skinny face</strong>: frictions help to revitalize the fat cells of your stored fat reserve, providing the necessary nutrition to accelerate the metabolism, and as a result, your fat deposits under the skin will recover!</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- You need your both index fingers for this action. The first one is for fixing and should not be moved. The second one is the working finger and will perform the main action.<br>- Place your fixing finger on the center part of your cheek, so that the fingertip would point to the middle of your eye, and its beginning would rest in the middle of the jawline.<br>- Place your working finger in parallel to the fixing one near the nose (the middle joint of your finger would touch the alar wing of the nose).<br>- Move the working finger to the fixing one, folding your tissues. You should try to pick up as many tissues as you can. Your fold can be bigger or smaller than the one on the video. This is absolutely normal! We all have different fat deposits under the skin, different liquid levels, different qualities of soft-tissues.<br>- Start moving your working finger slightly up and down keeping the fold firmly. Little by little the tissues would escape from your fold as a result of your frictions. If it slips out too fast, return to the folding again. Don&lsquo;t do the frictions more than twice on the same spot.<br>- Move your fixing finger toward the ear with the distance of 1 to 2 times bigger than your finger. The working finger starts moving from the place where the previous fold has slipped out. Do the same foldings and frictions as previously. Then move the fixing finger again like you did before and repeat the frictions.<br>- You can do 3 to 4 foldings on each cheek. It is not necessary to do more than 4.</p><p>- Repeat the sequence on the other side of your face.</p><p>- There is another variation. If your fingers are tired you can straighten your palm and use it instead repeating the sequence&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong></p><p>! Frictions should be done on CLEAN skin only! If you put on some oil or creme, your skin is going to be SO slippery! You won&rsquo;t be able to hold your skin folded and work with it properly<br>Remember, in this case, &ldquo;harder&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;better&rdquo;. &nbsp;Please, don&rsquo;t squeeze the tissues between your fingers for dear life!&nbsp;</p><p>! <strong>Skinny face</strong>: If you get a tired look after the frictions - stop practicing it and let your skin recover. Then start doing it again with half of the power and once in 3 days.</p><p>DO NOT THINK IT IS NOT YOUR CASE! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60e.svg);\">&nbsp;</span><br>I have made this exact mistake... until my loved ones would start noticing it. Well, recovery took some time, but everything is good after all. Remember the one-year-old kid touch rule and resume practicing 1 to 2 times a week.</p><p><em>Take it easy!&nbsp;<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\"> <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"\"></a></p>",

Today you learn the first basic technique, so please pay special attention to these muscles.</p><p>At first, a little bit of the anatomy.<br><span class=\"fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable fr-active\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"true\"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/542173520\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"fr-draggable\"></iframe></span><br>These muscles have long scientific names:<br>1. The muscle that lifts the upper lip and nose wing is called Musculus levator labii superioris alaequae nasi in Latin. It runs along the nose. Contracted it lifts the upper lip and the tip of the nose. The muscle is attached to the upper frontal process of the maxilla (visibly under the lacrimal canals of the eyes) &nbsp;and inserts into the skin of the lateral part of the nostril and upper lip.(F1)<br>2. The muscle that lifts the upper lip (lat. Musculus levator labii superioris) starts at the infraorbital margin (the lower margin of the eye socket) above the infraorbital foramen (a small opening in the bone below) and inserts into the skin of the lateral part of the nostril and upper lip. (F2)<br>These both muscles are very important for facial expressions. They contract visibly when we smell something stinky and say &quot;Phi ..&quot;. Therefore, as it is somewhat cumbersome to use their full names and for the sake of simplicity, we will call the one that is closer to the nose - F1, and the one that is farther from the nose - F2.<br>The F1 and F2 are the upper lip lifting muscles.<br>By contracting, they lift the lip and also form the nasolabial fold and the bumps above it. In a contracted state, the nasolabial fold is always present on the face ... and becomes more distinguished, if you do not relax these F lifters muscles properly.</p><p>So, let&#39;s start relaxing the F lifters muscles. At the same time, you get an excellent lymphatic drainage of the nasal area, which has lots of benefits:<br>- The nasolabial folds start to shrink.<br>- The asymmetry of the nose and the lacrimal grooves is leveled off.<br>- The bruises, dark circles and puffiness under the eyes starts to diminish.<br>- The F muscles are relaxed and prepared for the more advanced techniques.</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> Remember the rule of a one-year-old child&rsquo;s strength. Do not hurt yourself. You should feel comfortable during the whole exercise. You can adjust the strength for this exercise yourself later.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- You need both index and middle fingers for this exercise. Place them on the nasolabial fold so that the middle fingers are in the corners of the nose wings. The index and middle fingers are pressed together.<br>- Press in the soft tissues slightly, hold it like this for 3 to 5 seconds, and then begin small-amplitude circular massage movements. Circular motions in this case are similar to digging: inward, to the nose, then upwards with pressure, then outwards releasing the pressure and finally down.<br>- After a few circular movements, the index finger will reach the orbital bone. As soon as you feel this, raise your index finger, you no longer need it for the massage. Continue massaging with your middle fingers only until they reach the lacrimal canAls of the eyes.<br>- Slide your middle fingers to the nose wings starting from the lacrimal canals. The fingers go straight down the The muscle that lifts the upper lip and nose wing (F1). Feel them stretching and relaxing.<br>- Repeat it one more time. 2 sets shouldn&rsquo;t take longer than a minute.<br>- When you are done with the exercise, smooth out the skin surface pressing it with your fingers and moving upwards from below. Try to &ldquo;place&rdquo; the skin the way you would like to have it. It shouldn&rsquo;t take more than 5 to10 seconds.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>The exercise is easy and comforting but don&rsquo;t get carried away too much the first time. Remember, in this business, regularity is more important than intensity. And the increased intensity in the early stages can lead to discomfort the next day, which may make you want to stop or take a break. And breaks during the study course are not really useful.</p><p><em>Good luck! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Let&#39;s take a good look at F levators, especially at F1.</p><p><strong>2 action</strong>.<br>step 1. <strong>Compression</strong><br>With one index finger, we fix F1 at the level of the orbit, pressing the tissue tightly to the bone. With the second index finger, we press all soft tissue from the wing of the nose to the fixing one, forming a fold of tissues, while we think about the muscle and try to squeeze it. We hold the clamp for 20-30 seconds. (4 inhale-exhale rounds)</p><p>Step 2. <strong>Pressing</strong><br>We put both index fingers in the middle of F1 and sink them to the bone, hold the pressure for 5-10 seconds.</p><p>The task is to push the muscle in the middle, then stretching will follow.</p><p>In order not to be confused of the fact you could stretch the skin too much in step 3, you can push in, creating some additional skin fold for stretching beforehand.</p><p>Step 3. <strong>Stretching</strong><br>Without releasing the pressure, we stretch the F1 muscle towards its beginning and end very slowly. The upper finger slowly moves to the lacrimal canal, and the lower to the wing of the nose. Ideally, movement should last the same amount of time as compression. When the fingers have reached the end points, we continue to hold the pressure on them for another 5-10 seconds and release.</p><p>Step 4. <strong>Soothing the skin</strong><br>The top layers of the skin may look crumpled for a short time after such intense pressure and stretch marks. Let&#39;s help them find their rightful place as quickly as possible.</p><p>Using these light massage movements, you bring the skin back to the place where it is supposed to be. Pay attention to your sensations. After the first times you perform this massage, your muscle may ache a little, this is absolutely normal.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Good luck!<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

The lifting effect will be visible immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>It surely will not last long after the first time, but if you keep on doing it every day, the effect will last longer with every day. The temporal region affects the appearance of the entire face, not only the eyes and forehead. So, it needs to be included into your daily routine, and as a result you will have a facelift effect without any surgery. Not kidding, practice well and see for yourself. &nbsp;<span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f44c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Caution:&nbsp;</strong>You tighten the temples, not the eyes. So, please do not touch the skin around the eyes, it is very delicate.</p><p><span class=\"fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"true\"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/542666094\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"fr-draggable\"></iframe></span><br></p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- You need your both hands for this exercise. Place the base of your palms on the temples so that you do not touch the eyelids, the fingers are pointing to the crown.<br>- You slightly pull in your palms into the temples for 3 to 5 seconds. Place your elbows on the table, the head fixed between your hands, and relax your neck.<br>- As soon as you relax your neck, the head will naturally slide down under its own weight. Adjust the pressure with your palms so that your head slides down VERY slowly. This motion is over when the fingers meet at the crown. The way is short, so take your time. The slower you let your head slide, the better is the effect. 30 to 40 seconds should be enough for this motion.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>Be sure not to stretch your skin around your eyes. You work with the muscles of the temporal region on the deep level, not with the skin. The skin will tighten all by itself as the soft tissues under the skin improve.</p><p>From my personal experience, I can say that this is the fastest way to refresh your face in almost any situation. It is very fast and effective, if you for example need to look fresher for a photo.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Take care of your pretty eyes! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f64f.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</em></p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Normally we do not waste any thoughts on it. We just accept the fact that the face is swelling as years pass. In fact, the main reason for this is a clogged lymphatic system which makes our skin look thicker. We normally put up with it until it gets too heavy and starts pulling parts of a face down, bringing such unpleasant effects like loose skin, puffy lower eyelid and nasolabial folds.<br>Most of the lymph fluid from the face region goes through the lymph nodes in the neck area. If&nbsp;the lymph transport system doesn&rsquo;t work properly, it results in a clogged lymphatic system in the neck area. The more lymph is stagnating there, the more symptoms like uneven jawline, double chin, neck lines, fibrosis and lymphedema.<br>We are not going to dwell on the reasons for lymphedema, they are very complex and there are too many of them. Our goal is to make the lymph transport system work better in order to get rid of the unhealthy volume.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br><strong>1. Action</strong>. Warm-up with large pinches<br>All in all about 1 minute.<br>- You need both hands for this exercise. Use your thumbs and the index fingers formed to hooks. Pinch the area below the jaw. Try to grab as much soft tissues as possible when you do the pinches.<br>- Work your way through the area of your neck from the chin to Adam&#39;s apple. You can even go further down under the Adam&#39;s apple, if you feel like doing it.<br><strong>2. Action</strong>. Squeeze out excess of fluids<br>All in all about 1 minute for the both sides.<br>- Use the same thumbs and &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; but this time you work single-handed. On the right side you work with your right hand, on the left side with your left hand.<br>- Start working from the middle of the area under your chin. Take the thumb from the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; apart as much as possible. Place the thumb under the jaw angle, the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; should be under the chin. The thumb is for fixing and the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; is our working finger here. Squeeze out the soft tissues towards the thumb letting the flesh slip out from the pinch.<br>- As soon as the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; reaches the thumb, place the thumb closer to the ear and repeat the squeezing action. You may need to do up to 3 steps before you reach the ear.<br>- After that, place both the thumb and the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; further down along your neck and repeat the squeezing technique. Work your way through the whole area you warmed up in action 1.</p><p>Repeat the 2nd action on the other side.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>As always in this business, it is better to do it gently rather than zealously.<br>Especially when you do it for the first time. Later, you will figure out the correct amount of power you can apply.</p><p><em>Have fun! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p>*Lymphedema is chronic tissue swelling that happens when the lymphatic transport capacity is exceeded.<br>**Tissue fibrosis is the phenomenon in which a tissue has a progressive deposition of collagen fibers with age.

We chew and smile many times a day, and when we&rsquo;re nervous or angry, we grit our teeth. With age, this residual spasm leads to shortening and thickening of the chewing muscles. When we are young, these muscles lie flat from the cheekbones to the lower jaw... Because of the spasm, the muscles gather in one dense bump, pull the corner of the lower jaw upward, disrupting the performance of the mandibular joint, change the angle of inclination of the lower jaw, and the tissues of the cheeks are sagging down and displacing to the center.<br>Relaxing the chewing muscles helps to:<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; restore a clear oval of the face.<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; reduce or completely get rid of defects in the middle part of the face, such as: nasolabial folds, flabby sagging cheeks.<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; get rid of the habit of clenching teeth, due to which teeth will wear out less, prevention of bruxism.</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>Massaging the chewing muscles can be painful both during execution and for a while after. This is normal and will go away with continued practice. You can relieve discomfort with a dry warm compress on the area of the chewing muscles.</p><p><strong>Technique:</strong><br><strong>1 step</strong>. Warm up.<br>Start the massage by warming up the chewing muscles.<br>Perform it with the upper part of the palm (metacarpophalangeal joints, see picture below), with the pads at the base of the fingers. Open your mouth, relax the lower jaw and knead the large chewing muscles in circular movements from the center to the periphery for 30 seconds.

Stretching the Superficial and Deep Masseter muscles.<br>The pads in the upper part of the palm (metacarpophalangeal joints) will be the working ones.<br>Put you palms on the cheeks so that proximal interphalangeal joints rest on the cheekbones. Pull soft tissues up to reach the cheeckbone with the working pads, press them in and relax the lower jaw slightly opening the mouth. Now slowly pull the pressed the Superficial and Deep Masseter muscles down in 5 seconds. Without letting the skin off return the working pads to the starting position.

                "exerciseDescription": "<p><strong>Vacuum massage for forehead&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Renewed skin with only the power of a small silicone cup!<br>The vacuum massage (VM) affects the secretion of collagen and elastin:<br>- skin gets rid of toxins and looks fresher;<br>- bags and dark circles under eyes disappear;<br>- pores shrink;<br>- wrinkles get smoothed.</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> Do not overdo it. After a vacuum massage (VM), the face should blush a little - this is called hyperemia. This is what we are trying to achieve. Light hyperemia will disappear within half a day, in a day at the very latest. However, if you &quot;work too hard&quot;, it may stay for several days. Be careful, this is your face after all!</p><p>There are contraindications to a vacuum massage:<br>- acute diseases and flare-up of chronic conditions;<br>- skin defects;<br>- thrombophlebitis (vein inflammation);<br>- increased fragility and vascular permeability (disrupted blood supply to soft tissues);<br>- severe cardiovascular disease (severe disease involving heart or blood vessels);<br>- mental disorders;<br>- age over 80.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- You need oil to perform this massage technique (see the oil guide). Use a silicon cup with a diameter of about 1 inch (2.5-3 cm). Put a few drops on your palms, rub them, and place your palms on your face. Also add some oil on the cup&#39;s working surface directly for better gliding. ⠀<br>- No need to create a strong vacuum!<br><strong>1. Action</strong> - suction.<br>- Create a vacuum with a cup by grabbing the cup between your thumb and index finger and squeezing it. Press it to your skin and then let it go. This would create a vacuum that sticks the cup to your face by picking up the skin underneath.<br>-Leave the cup sticking to your skin for 5 to 10 seconds.<br>- Repeat this action several times on different parts of your forehead.<br><strong>2. Action</strong> - circular movements.<br>- Press the squeezed cup to your skin creating the vacuum. The cup should be able to move without losing the vacuum &ndash; this is exactly what you need. 2 to 3 circular movements on one spot, then you can move on to the next part of your forehead and repeat the action.<br><strong>3. Action</strong> - horizontal movements.<br>- Press the squeezed cup to your skin creating the vacuum and drag the cup horizontally across your forehead. If the cup has lost the vacuum, create the vacuum and continue from the same place. Vertical movements are also possible.</p><p>- The time you spend on every area is very individual and depends on the sensitivity of your skin, on how much vacuum you created and so on. Perform the massage until your skin is slightly red. No more and no less.</p><p><strong>Important !⠀</strong><br>Make sure to wash off the oil or other massage product afterwards! Don&#39;t leave it on your skin.<br>During the vacuum massage, the skin releases many substances that will not have a beneficial effect on it! These substances must be removed from the skin, otherwise it can result in irritation, redness or skin peeling off.<br>Make sure that the vacuum you create is minimal!<br>Do not try to pull too much skin into the cup.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Be gentle with yourself,</em><br><em>Good luck! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f60c.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p>Move on to the VM for middle face.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

You can also add some oil on the cup&#39;s base directly for better gliding. ⠀<br>- No need to create a strong vacuum!<br><strong>1. Action</strong> - suction.<br>- Create a vacuum with a cup so that the cup sticks well to your skin and leave it for 5-10 seconds there. Start the VM of the middle face from the area next to your nose, then move on to the next place toward your ear and repeat the action.<br><strong>2. Action</strong> - circular movements.<br>- Press the squeezed cup to your skin creating the vacuum. The cup should be able to move without losing the vacuum &ndash; this is exactly what you need. 2 to 3 circular movements on one spot, then you can move on to the next part of your face and repeat the action.<br>- In the middle face, the skin is more flexible than on the forehead, so that the circular movements should be done more careful! If in doubt, skip the action 2 and go straight to the action 3.<br><strong>3. Action</strong> - horizontal movements.<br>- Press the squeezed cup to your skin creating the vacuum and drag the cup horizontally from the nose to your ear and slightly upward. If the cup has lost the vacuum, create it again and continue from the same place.<br>- Working on the middle face, you can only perform horizontal motions from nose to ear.<br>- The time you spend on every area is very individual and depends on the sensitivity of your skin, on how much vacuum you created and so on.

                "exerciseDescription": "<p><strong>Laying on the roller</strong></p><p>Unique, easy, relaxing and super effective exercise to release spasms in your spine inner muscles and improve neck static. &nbsp;Look at the picture, look at the muscles supporting the spine from outside and inside (long muscle of the neck, lat. &quot;longus colli&quot;) of the spine bone, they connect vertebrae one to others. What? Do you think happens, when they get into spasmodic state? They cement the curves of the spine that actually we need to straighten for the sake of better wellbeing and rejuvenation.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>We can&#39;t reach the anterior surface of the spine with hands to massage them. These inner muscles can be relaxed only by prolonged stretching, not shorter than 5 minutes. Even in yoga, you will not find the poses that can help their relaxation effectively. Only laying on the rolls can really help in relaxing inner spine muscles to improve the situation around 7th cervical vertebra, which normally sticks out with ageing.&nbsp;</p><p>Technique is simple, but there are precautions:<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is not for pregnant<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; Coming out of this exercise should be VERY slow and delicate because you stretch your spine, so fast jump out from the pose can cause lumbago.<br><span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f449.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; You may &nbsp;fall asleep in this pose. This is OK. Just come out of it even slower.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>1. Make roll from a bath towel. Fold it twice along its length, roll and tie it up with a ribbon. You can adjust thickness and hardness of the roll according to your need by softening or tightening the ribbon. For the beginning, start with loosen ribbon.</p><p>2. Prepare the place on the flat solid surface like a floor, make sure that you get no wind over there. Use yoga mat or a rag to lay on.</p><p><strong>1 action.</strong> Under the lower back. 5-10 minutes.<br>Sit with the crossed legs, place the roll under the lower back perpendicular to it. Lay down on the mat, straiten your legs and relax. Heels are at the same width as your shoulders, arms stretched out over your head. Relax and breathe evenly. Relax in this pose for 5-10 minutes.<br>To make the stretching deeper, connect your big toes, keeping the heels on the same spots, and put your palms on the floor over your head with elbows pointing upwards.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT.</strong> Coming out of the pose is very slow. First, turn your body on the side and pull out the roll from the lower back. If you finished the exercise, slowly get onto your hands and knees and do simple bands of the spine, then slowly get up on the feet.</p><p><strong>2 action.</strong> Under the middle of the back. 5-10 minutes.</p><p>From the previous action pose turn on your side and adjust the roll higher, to the middle of the back, again perpendicular to the spine, and again lay on it and relax. &nbsp;For deeper stretching, do the same toes connection and palms set on floor. Relax for 5-10 minutes.<br><strong>IMPORTANT.</strong> Coming out of the pose is very slow.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3 action</strong>. Under the shoulder blades perpendicular. 5-10 minutes.</p><p>From the previous action pose turn on your side and adjust the roll higher, under the shoulder blades, again perpendicular to the spine, and again lay on it and relax. &nbsp;For deeper stretching, do the same toes connection and palms set on floor. Relax for 5-10 minutes.<br><strong>IMPORTANT.</strong> Coming out of the pose is very slow.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4 action.</strong> Between the shoulder blades, along the spine. 5-10 minutes.</p><p>From the previous action pose turn on your side and change orientation of the roll, this time set it along the spine, between your shoulder blades. One end of the roll should be at the 7th cervical vertebra area, so that the cervical vertebrae and head would be lower than the rest of the spine resting on the roll. Relax on the roll. &nbsp;</p><p>For deeper stretching relaxation of the inner spine muscles, do few swings of arms in opposite directions. One arm along the body, the other is stretched straight over your head, change their positions. Try to do 10 swings like this, then relax for 5-10 minutes. Do the same toes connection and palms set on floor for deeper stretching if you fell like it.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT.</strong> Coming out of the pose is very slow. First, turn your body on the side. Slowly get on all fours and do simple backbends, then slowly get to your feet.</p><p>Relaxation on the roll should be very deep, you may get sleepy easily. Do not let yourself fall asleep, especially when you just start practising this technique.</p><p><strong>Feeling sleepy?</strong> Make a couple of deep breaths and turn on your side, remove the roll from under your body and enjoy pleasant relaxation in your back. Always keep in mind that you have relaxed your spine very well, vertebrae got to forgotten positions and got stretched out from each other a bit, restructuring to the healthier spine state. This healthy state of spine got forgotten by the tissues surrounding your vertebrae. If you return very fast to the regular vertical position, some little tissues may get clamped by vertebrae just a bit. This bit can cause a giant pain, so be careful when you get up. When you do it slowly, with awareness, all the tissues will find their righteous places, and you will feel just great!</p><p><br></p><p>Love your spine and live long happy life! <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",
