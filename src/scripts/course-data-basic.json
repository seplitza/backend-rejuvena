You can increase the height and the number, when you feel like it.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- Find a free space with a solid floor.<br>- Go on your tiptoes and let your body weight fall naturally on your heels. Continue these jumps, gradually increasing the jumping height and the speed.<br>- Do about 30 to 40 jumps the first time. You can gradually increase the number of jumps up to 100 on the following days of practice.</p><p><strong>Important!</strong><br>Do not lift your toes off the floor, it is not necessary to bounce, but to hit the floor with your heels. The floor still can shake. Be sure to choose a solid floor. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have swelling in your entire body, you can repeat this jumping exercise in the afternoon and in the evening, but not later than 1 hour before going to bed.
