Jumping can be replaced by running in place.<br>The best time for this exercise is in the morning when you just woke up and still did not even have a glass of water or so.</p><p>What does this jump-the-lymph-exercise give us?<br>- Lymphatic system receives support in cleansing from cell waste;<br>- The body is mobilized, the metabolism is accelerated;<br>- It is the number-one-treatment for skin laxity;<br>- Cellulite is reduced;<br>- Excess fluid is slowly removed, which results in reduction of edemas and all the edematous congestion.</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> The course is designed for conventionally healthy people. If you have any chronic medical conditions or have recently had a surgery, please do not jump.<br>Pregnant women should also not jump.</p><p>Ladies, hold your breast while jumping.<br>If you are overweight, you should start with easy jumping, which means a low jumping height and a lower number of jumps. You can increase the height and the number, when you feel like it.</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>- Find a free space with a solid floor.<br>- Go on your tiptoes and let your body weight fall naturally on your heels. Continue these jumps, gradually increasing the jumping height and the speed.<br>- Do about 30 to 40 jumps the first time. You can gradually increase the number of jumps up to 100 on the following days of practice.</p><p><strong>Important!</strong><br>Do not lift your toes off the floor, it is not necessary to bounce, but to hit the floor with your heels. The floor still can shake. Be sure to choose a solid floor. <span class=\"fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img\" style=\"background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f609.svg);\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have swelling in your entire body, you can repeat this jumping exercise in the afternoon and in the evening, but not later than 1 hour before going to bed.

So, you normally shouldn&rsquo;t feel tired afterwards.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technique</strong><br>Find a suitable spot where you can move freely in one place.<br>Simply start running in place. No need in big or sharp movements. It is much more important to slightly hop from one foot to another. That is the minimum you should try to perform. You can add some movements to your arms, too, if you want to boost the effect. Keep running for about a minute. Breathe evenly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Attention!</strong><br>Do not tense any part of your body. Relax your shoulders, arms and hands.
